name: Aarke
description: Aarke is a Swedish kitchen appliance brand that elevates everyday hydration into a sculptural ritual. The palette is anchored by a deep, almost-black ink (`#232322`) and a crisp, cool white canvas (`#fafafa`), with a signature teal-green primary (`#108474`) that evokes Nordic waters and stainless steel patina. This primary appears sparingly — on the carbonator button, the occasional accent line, and the brand's "NEW" badge — lending it the weight of a deliberate design choice rather than a default. Supporting tones are a gallery of warm grays: `#eeeeee` for soft surfaces, `#dddddd` for hairline borders, `#cccccc` for muted text, and `#999999` for placeholder states. A single accent of warm yellow (`#fbcd0a`) cuts through the monochrome on select product highlights, while a whisper of lavender (`#a89cc8`) and pale teal (`#c1e6e6`) appear in editorial photography overlays, hinting at a broader lifestyle palette. Typography is built on GT Walsheim Pro — a geometric sans-serif with a friendly, slightly condensed character — used in three weights: Light for body copy, Medium for buttons and secondary navigation, and Bold for display headlines. The brand trusts generous whitespace, hard edges (most corners are `{rounded.none}` or `{rounded.xs}`), and the material honesty of brushed stainless steel and borosilicate glass. There is no visual noise: the site reads like a product catalog for a design museum gift shop, where every component — from the pill-shaped search bar (`{rounded.full}`) to the product card's subtle `{rounded.sm}` — is a quiet invitation to slow down and consider the object.

## Components

### Buttons
**`button-primary`** — The primary call-to-action button uses the brand's signature teal-green (`#108474`) as a solid fill with white text. It has zero border-radius, reflecting the brand's preference for sharp, architectural edges. On hover, it deepens to `#0d6b5d`; when disabled, it fades to a pale teal (`#c1e6e6`). The button uses GT Walsheim Pro Medium at 15px with 0.3px letter spacing, and sits at 48px tall with 14px/32px padding. **`button-secondary`** — An outlined variant with a white fill and ink text, maintaining the same 48px height and zero border-radius. On hover, it gains a soft gray fill (`#f2f2f2`). **`button-tertiary-text`** — A text-only button with no background or border, used for ghost actions like "Cancel" or "Learn more." **`button-pill-primary`** — A pill-shaped variant (`{rounded.full}`) used sparingly for the search bar and newsletter signup, with the same teal fill and white text but smaller padding (10px 24px) and smaller type (13px). **`button-pill-outline`** — An outlined pill button with a transparent fill and ink text, used for secondary actions in hero sections.

### Cards
**`product-card`** — The product card is a clean white container with a softly rounded corner (`{rounded.sm}`) and no shadow, relying on the product photography to carry visual weight. On hover, the entire card gains a subtle `#f2f2f2` background. The title uses `{typography.title-sm}` in ink, the price uses `{typography.body-md}` in body gray, and a small badge (`{typography.badge}`) sits in the top-left corner with a teal fill for "NEW" or yellow fill for "SALE." **`review-card`** — A white card with `{rounded.sm}` and 16px padding, containing the review text in `{typography.body-sm}` and the author name in `{typography.title-sm}`. Star ratings are rendered in the ink color at 16px.

### Navigation
**`nav-bar`** — The top navigation bar is a 72px-tall white strip with uppercase nav links set in GT Walsheim Pro Medium Secondary at 14px with 0.5px letter spacing. Active links are ink; inactive links are muted gray. The bar is fixed at the top with a subtle bottom hairline (`#dddddd`). **`search-bar`** — A pill-shaped search input with a `#f2f2f2` background, 44px tall, and 10px/20px padding. On focus, the background shifts to white. **`breadcrumb`** — A simple text-based breadcrumb trail using `{typography.caption}` in muted gray, with the active page in ink and a hairline separator.

### Forms
**`text-input`** — A 48px-tall input with zero border-radius, white background, and 12px/16px padding. On focus, it gains a teal border; on error, a red border (`#c13515`). **`select-dropdown`** — Matches the text-input styling but includes a dropdown arrow. **`quantity-selector`** — A compact 48px-tall control with a soft gray button on each side and a white center for the quantity value.

### Footer
**`footer`** — The footer is a full-width section with an ink background (`#232322`) and white text. Links are set in `{typography.link}` at a muted gray (`#999999`) and brighten to white on hover. Section headings use `{typography.uppercase-tag}` in white. The footer uses 48px vertical padding.

### Accordion
**`accordion`** — A clean, borderless accordion with an ink header in `{typography.title-sm}` and body text in `{typography.body-md}`. The header has 16px vertical padding; the content area has 8px top and 16px bottom padding. No background or border — just typographic hierarchy.

### Tabs
**`tab-active`** — A text-only tab with ink color and a 2px teal underline. **`tab-inactive`** — Same typography but muted gray with a 1px hairline underline. Used for product detail sections (Description, Specifications, Reviews).

### Pagination
**`pagination`** — A simple numbered pagination strip. Active page gets a teal fill with white text; inactive pages are muted gray. Hover state adds a soft gray background.

## Responsive Behavior

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile | < 744px | Single-column layout; nav collapses to hamburger; product cards stack vertically; hero text reduces to `{typography.display-md}`; footer links stack; search bar becomes full-width; accordion replaces tabbed content |
| Tablet | 744–1128px | Two-column product grid; nav links remain visible but condensed; hero uses `{typography.display-lg}`; footer uses two-column layout; search bar remains pill-shaped but narrower |
| Desktop | 1128–1440px | Three-column product grid; full nav bar with all links; hero uses `{typography.display-xl}`; footer uses four-column layout; product cards show hover states |
| Wide | > 1440px | Max-width container (1440px) centered; product grid can expand to four columns; hero section uses larger padding; whitespace increases proportionally |

### Touch Targets
- All interactive elements (buttons, links, inputs) have a minimum touch target of 44x44px on mobile.
- Product card taps navigate to product detail; no hover states on mobile.
- Accordion headers have 48px minimum height for easy tapping.
- Quantity selector buttons are 48x48px.
- Bottom nav (mobile) uses 56px-tall icons with 44px touch targets.

### Collapsing Strategy
- Top nav collapses to a hamburger menu at < 744px; the hamburger icon is 44x44px.
- Product filters collapse into a bottom sheet or modal on mobile.
- Footer columns collapse to a single column on mobile, with accordion-style section headers.
- Tabbed content (product details) collapses to an accordion on mobile.
- Search bar collapses to an icon that expands to full-width input on tap.
- Breadcrumb collapses to show only the current page and a "Back" link on mobile.

## Known Gaps

- Hover states for buttons and cards were inferred from common patterns; exact transition durations and easing curves were not extractable.
- Error states for forms (validation messages, error icons) were not visible on the live site; colors and styling are best-guess based on brand palette.
- Dark mode is not implemented on the live site; no dark-mode tokens are defined.
- Sub-brand palettes (e.g., for Aarke Carbonator vs. Aarke Accessories) may exist but were not distinguishable from the extracted data.
- The exact font-weight mapping for GT Walsheim Pro variants (Light, Medium, Bold) was inferred from common usage; actual CSS may use numeric weights (300, 500, 700).
- The `#a89cc8` (lavender) and `#c1e6e6` (pale teal) colors appear in editorial imagery but may not be official brand tokens; they are included as accents.
- The `#fbcd0a` yellow is used sparingly; its exact role (sale badge vs. accent) is inferred.
- The `#1990c6` and `#136f99` blues appear in the extracted colors but were not observed in prominent UI elements; they may be legacy or secondary.
- The `#f9fafb` color appears in the extracted list but is very close to white; it may be a subtle surface variant.
- The `#8f8f8f` and `#7b7b7b` grays appear but their specific roles (muted vs. muted-soft) are inferred.
- The `#3c3c3c` and `#555555` grays appear but are close to the defined `body` and `muted` tokens; they may be legacy.
- The `#dedede` and `#e9e9e9` grays are close to `hairline-soft` and `surface-strong`; exact mapping is inferred.
- The `#121212` color is used as the scrim token; its opacity value (0.3 for hero overlay) is inferred.
- The `#efefef` and `#f9f9f9` colors are very close to `surface-soft` and `canvas`; they may be legacy or slightly different surfaces.
- The `#adadad` and `#bbbbbb` grays are close to `muted-soft`; exact mapping is inferred.
- The `#edf5f5` color is a very pale teal that may be a legacy surface color.
- The `#e8e8e8` color is used as `surface-strong`; its exact role is inferred.
