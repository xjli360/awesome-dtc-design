name: Amigo Games
description: A press release page for Amigo Games, the card game publisher behind *The Game* and *Saboteur*, uses a starkly utilitarian interface that prioritizes information delivery over visual personality. The page is built entirely on a white canvas (`#ffffff`) with black ink (`#000000`) and a single blue accent (`#1990c6`) reserved exclusively for hyperlinks — no primary brand color, no decorative flourishes, no game-themed illustration. Body text runs at 16px in a system font stack (Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif) with 1.5 line-height, creating a reading experience indistinguishable from a government document or academic press release. The only design move that signals "this is a games company" is the logo lockup at the top: a red-and-white square mark (unreadable in extraction) paired with the wordmark, set against the white field. Below that, the page is a single column of text blocks — headline in bold 24px, dateline in italic 14px, body paragraphs separated by 24px gaps — with no cards, no CTAs, no product imagery, no social proof. The blue link color (`#1990c6`) is the only non-neutral element, and it appears only in the email contact at the bottom. This is a brand that, in this context, has chosen to disappear into the generic web — the design system is essentially the browser default with a logo pasted on top.

## Components

### Buttons
**`button-primary`** — A flat, rectangular button with no border radius, using the blue accent (`#1990c6`) as background and white text. On hover, shifts to `#1478a8` (`primary-active`). Disabled state uses `#b3d9f0` (`primary-disabled`). Padding is 12px vertical, 24px horizontal, with 44px height. This button is not present on the press release page but would be used for any game purchase or sign-up flow.

**`button-secondary`** — White background with black text and a 1px `#cccccc` border. Same dimensions as primary. Used for secondary actions like "Learn More" or "View All Games." No border radius — consistent with the brand's flat, no-frills approach.

### Links
**`link-inline`** — The only interactive element on the press release page. Blue (`#1990c6`) with underline, 16px Arial. Visited state shifts to `#551a8b` (browser default). No hover color change detected — likely remains blue. Used for email addresses and external references.

### Navigation
**`nav-bar`** — A simple 60px white bar at the top of the page, containing the logo lockup and a horizontal list of text links (Games, About, Press, Contact). Links are 14px Arial, black, no underline until hover. No dropdowns, no search, no icons — just text.

### Logo
**`logo-lockup`** — An 80px-tall white container holding the Amigo Games logo: a red (`#cc0000`) square mark with a white geometric shape (likely a stylized "A" or game piece) alongside the wordmark in black Arial. The logo is left-aligned and does not link to the homepage (it's already on the page).

### Press Release
**`press-release-headline`** — 24px bold Arial, black, no letter-spacing. Set as a single `<h1>` at the top of the content area. No decorative line, no icon, no background — just text on white.

**`press-release-dateline`** — 14px italic Arial, gray (`#666666`), placed directly below the headline. Contains the city, date, and "—" em dash before the body text begins.

**`press-release-body`** — 16px regular Arial, dark gray (`#333333`), 1.5 line-height. Paragraphs separated by 24px gaps. No images, no pull quotes, no sidebars — a single column of text.

### Footer
**`footer-contact`** — 14px Arial, gray (`#666666`), containing the company address and email link. The email uses `link-inline` styling. No social media icons, no newsletter signup, no sitemap — just a text block.

## Responsive Behavior

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile | < 744px | Single column layout; logo lockup shrinks to 60px height; body text remains 16px; margins reduce to 16px on each side |
| Tablet | 744–1128px | Content max-width at 720px centered; logo lockup at 80px; margins at 24px |
| Desktop | 1128–1440px | Content max-width at 960px centered; full logo lockup height; margins at 32px |
| Wide | > 1440px | Content max-width at 1120px centered; no further scaling |

### Touch Targets
- All links: minimum 44px height (text only, no padding)
- Logo lockup: 80px height, easily tappable
- No buttons present on press release page

### Collapsing Strategy
- No navigation menu to collapse (text links remain visible at all widths)
- No images to hide or resize
- Content remains single column at all breakpoints
- Logo lockup reduces height on mobile but does not collapse

## Known Gaps

- No font-family declarations could be extracted from the live site — the system font stack (Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif) is inferred from browser defaults and common practice; the brand may use a custom typeface on other pages
- No primary brand color could be extracted — the blue `#1990c6` is used only for links and may not be the brand's actual primary; the red `#cc0000` in the logo is a candidate but could not be confirmed from CSS
- No hover states, active states, or focus styles could be extracted for any interactive element
- No button components exist on the press release page — button styling is speculative based on common patterns
- No form elements, error states, or validation styling could be extracted
- No dark mode or high-contrast mode styling detected
- No animation, transition, or interaction patterns could be extracted
- The press release page may not be representative of the full brand experience — product pages, game instructions, and e-commerce flows likely have richer design systems
- No social media icons, share buttons, or footer navigation could be extracted
- No card components, grid systems, or layout patterns beyond single-column text could be confirmed
