description: A VR-accessory brand that wraps its hardware in a dark, almost automotive palette — #1f2021 and #141414 dominate the canvas, not white, giving the storefront the feel of a cockpit interior rather than a consumer-gadget shop. The single voltage is #44b5ed, a cyan-blue accent that appears on add-to-cart buttons, hover states, and the glowing ring around product photography, reading as the LED of a headset powering on. Type runs Inter at 400/600 weight for body and Sora at 600 for display headlines, with Space Grotesk appearing in badge and price contexts for a slightly more technical, monolinear feel. Product cards use {rounded.md} corners on a #222222 surface, with a hairline border at #383838 that barely separates card from canvas — the brand trusts darkness and density over whitespace. The top nav is a fixed bar at #1f2021 with a search icon and cart badge, and the hero section pushes a single hero product against a gradient from #141414 to #1f2021, with the cyan CTA floating at {rounded.full}. Badges for "NEW" and "SALE" appear in #ec0101 and #ffc23d respectively, creating two additional signal colors that break the dark field with urgency. The overall effect is a brand that sells accessories for a device you wear on your face, and the site itself feels like the inside of that device: dark, precise, lit by a single bright indicator.

## Components

### Buttons
**`button-primary`** — The primary call-to-action, rendered as a pill with the brand's cyan-blue (#44b5ed) fill and dark ink text. On hover, shifts to `{colors.primary-active}` (#3b9ce0). Disabled state drops to a pale cyan `{colors.primary-disabled}` with dark text, signaling the action is unavailable without visual noise. Used for "Add to Cart", "Buy Now", and hero CTAs.

**`button-secondary`** — An outlined pill on a dark card surface, with cyan text and a subtle hairline border. On hover, the border shifts to the active cyan and the background lightens slightly. Used for "Learn More", "View Details", and secondary checkout flows.

**`button-ghost`** — A text-only button with no background or border, rendered in muted gray. Used for "Cancel", "Close", and tertiary navigation actions. Hover state not yet extracted — likely shifts to `{colors.body}`.

### Text Inputs
**`text-input`** — A dark card background (#222222) with a hairline border (#383838) and 12px padding. On focus, the border swaps to `{colors.primary}` cyan. Used in search, newsletter signup, and checkout forms. Placeholder text is `{colors.muted}` (#878787). Error state not yet extracted — likely uses `{colors.error}` border.

### Navigation
**`nav-bar`** — A fixed top bar at 64px height, using the darkest canvas (#141414) with a subtle bottom hairline. Navigation links are muted gray at 500 weight, with the active page or hover state shifting to `{colors.primary}`. The search icon is a `{rounded.full}` ghost button, and the cart icon carries a `{rounded.full}` cyan badge with a count.

### Product Cards
**`product-card`** — A dark card (#222222) with 12px rounded corners and a hairline border. On hover, the border turns cyan. The product image sits in a top region with rounded top corners, and the price is rendered in Space Grotesk at 18px/600 weight in muted gray. Badges for "NEW" (red) or "SALE" (amber) appear in the top-left corner as small uppercase labels.

### Badges
**`badge-new`** — A small uppercase label in red (#ec0101) with dark text, 4px rounded corners, and tight padding. Used to flag newly released accessories.
**`badge-sale`** — Same shape as the new badge but in amber (#ffc23d) with dark ink. Used for discounted items.

### Hero Section
**`hero-section`** — A full-width section with a dark gradient from #141414 to #1f2021, containing a single hero product image, a headline in Sora display-xl, and a large `{rounded.full}` cyan CTA button. The hero uses generous vertical padding (64px) and centers its content. The product image often has a subtle cyan glow or halo effect.

### Footer
**`footer`** — A dark canvas section with a hairline top border, containing link columns in muted gray. Links hover to cyan. The footer uses 48px vertical padding and a 16px grid for link columns. Social icons (not yet extracted) likely use `{colors.muted}` with cyan hover.

## Responsive Behavior

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile | < 744px | Nav bar collapses to hamburger menu; product cards go single-column; hero reduces to 32px padding; search becomes a full-width overlay; footer links stack vertically. |
| Tablet | 744–1128px | Nav bar shows condensed links (icons + labels); product cards in 2-column grid; hero maintains 48px padding; footer in 2-column layout. |
| Desktop | 1128–1440px | Full nav bar with text links; product cards in 3- or 4-column grid; hero at 64px padding; footer in 4-column layout. |
| Wide | > 1440px | Max-width container at 1440px; product cards may show 4-5 columns; hero content centered with larger display text. |

### Touch Targets
- All buttons and interactive elements are minimum 44px height (48px standard).
- Cart badge is 20px minimum — acceptable for desktop, but on mobile the touch target is the parent icon (40px).
- Search icon button is 40px — meets touch target minimum.
- Nav links on mobile are 48px tap targets in the hamburger menu.

### Collapsing Strategy
- On mobile (< 744px), the top nav collapses to a hamburger icon and a slide-out drawer.
- Product cards collapse from multi-column to single-column, with images stacking vertically.
- The hero section reduces vertical padding from 64px to 32px, and the CTA button shrinks to full-width.
- Footer links collapse from 4 columns to a single vertical stack.
- Search transforms from an inline icon to a full-screen overlay with a text input.

## Known Gaps

- **Hover states** for ghost buttons, text inputs, and footer links are inferred from brand patterns but not extracted from the live site.
- **Error and success states** for forms (red/green borders, error messages) are not extracted — the error hex (#eb001b) and success hex (#428445) are present in the color list but their usage context is unconfirmed.
- **Dark mode** is not applicable — the brand already uses a dark canvas as default.
- **Sub-brand palettes** (e.g., for AMVR Pro or AMVR Lite product lines) are not extracted.
- **Typography scale** for mobile (smaller font sizes) is not extracted — the values above are desktop defaults.
- **Animation and transition** timing (hover fades, card entrance, nav slide) are not extracted.
- **Social icon colors** (YouTube, Instagram, etc.) are present in the extracted hex list but their specific usage is unconfirmed — they may be brand-specific or platform defaults.
- **Checkout flow** colors (Shopify Pay, Klarna, Afterpay widgets) are likely present in the extracted list but are not part of the brand's core design system.
- **The extracted color list is large (27 hexes)** and includes many generic web colors (grays, blues, greens) that may be framework defaults or stock-image tones. The brand's true primary is identified as #44b5ed (cyan-blue), but secondary accents like #5b69c3 (purple-blue) and #fc9d01 (orange) may also be brand-significant — their usage is unconfirmed.
