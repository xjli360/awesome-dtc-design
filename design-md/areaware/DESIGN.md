description: A puzzle and design-object brand that uses a warm, almost domestic palette anchored on a butter-yellow #fff299 — a color that reads like afternoon light on a kitchen table, not like a brand primary. The extracted palette is unusually broad for a DTC site: alongside the yellow sit a dusty rose #fcd6d7, a sage green #d3efcd, a deep navy #3a5792, and a cherry red #c72e2f, suggesting Areaware treats color as a product language rather than a system constraint. Buttons and interactive elements take a soft pill shape (`{rounded.full}`), and the canvas is a warm off-white #f5f5f5 rather than pure white, giving the whole experience the feel of a well-loved apartment rather than a sterile gallery. The typography stack is system-native — Helvetica Neue, Arial, sans-serif — which is a deliberate choice: the brand lets the objects and their saturated colors do the talking, not a custom typeface. Product cards use generous whitespace and `{rounded.md}` corners, and the overall mood is one of gentle, curated playfulness — puzzles and home goods presented not as commodities but as objects with personality. The gray #9ca3af appears as a muted secondary text and hairline color, keeping the interface quiet so the product photography and those distinctive accent colors can sing. There is no heavy hero section; instead, the brand leads with a grid of product cards, each one a small invitation.

## Components

### Buttons
**`button-primary`** — The primary call-to-action, used for "Add to Cart", "Checkout", and key conversion points. Rendered as a full-width or inline pill with the brand's signature butter-yellow `{colors.primary}` background. On hover, it shifts to `{colors.primary-active}`. The disabled state uses `{colors.primary-disabled}` with `{colors.muted}` text to signal inactivity without visual noise. Text is uppercase with tight letter-spacing, giving it a confident, editorial weight.

**`button-secondary`** — A ghost button with a subtle hairline border, used for secondary actions like "View Details" or "Save for Later". Inherits the same pill shape and uppercase typography as the primary, but sits on the `{colors.canvas}` background with `{colors.ink}` text. On hover, the background fills with `{colors.hairline-soft}` and the border darkens to `{colors.muted}`.

**`button-tertiary`** — A text-only button with no background or border, used for low-emphasis actions like "Cancel" or "Clear Filters". Matches the primary button's typography and pill shape but remains transparent until hover, where a subtle background shift could be applied.

**`button-accent-rose` / `button-accent-sage`** — Thematic accent buttons used for limited-edition drops, seasonal collections, or promotional banners. They follow the same pill and uppercase pattern as the primary but swap the yellow for `{colors.accent-rose}` (dusty pink) or `{colors.accent-sage}` (soft green), allowing the brand to color-code campaigns without breaking the system.

### Cards
**`product-card`** — The core content unit of the site, used in grid layouts on the homepage, category pages, and search results. A white `{colors.surface-card}` background with `{rounded.md}` corners and a whisper-thin shadow. The image occupies the top portion with matching rounded top corners and a 1:1 aspect ratio. Below, the product title uses `{typography.title-sm}` and the price uses `{typography.body-sm}` in `{colors.body}`. On hover, the shadow deepens to signal interactivity. No border — the card floats on the `{colors.canvas}` page background.

### Navigation
**`nav-bar`** — A fixed-height top bar at 64px, using `{colors.canvas}` background and `{colors.ink}` text. Navigation links use `{typography.nav-link}` in uppercase with subtle letter-spacing. A thin `{colors.hairline-soft}` bottom border separates it from the page content. When scrolled, a light box-shadow replaces the border for a subtle elevation effect. The logo sits left-aligned, with category links and a search icon on the right.

### Forms
**`text-input`** — Standard input fields for email capture, search, and checkout forms. A white background with `{colors.hairline}` border and `{rounded.sm}` corners. On focus, the border becomes a 2px `{colors.primary}` stroke. Error states use a 2px `{colors.accent-red}` border. Height is 48px for comfortable touch targeting.

**`search-bar`** — A pill-shaped search input with `{rounded.full}`, used in the navigation and on search results pages. Same white background and hairline border as the text input, but with a taller pill silhouette. On focus, the border switches to `{colors.primary}`.

### Badges
**`badge-new`** — A small, pill-shaped badge with a sage green `{colors.accent-sage}` background, used to flag newly added products. Uppercase, bold, 11px type.

**`badge-sale`** — A red `{colors.accent-red}` badge with white text, used for discounted items. Same pill shape and typography as the new badge, but with higher urgency.

**`badge-limited`** — A rose `{colors.accent-rose}` badge for limited-edition or low-stock items. Follows the same pattern, adding a third color to the badge system without visual clutter.

### Footer
**`footer`** — A full-width footer with `{colors.canvas}` background, separated from the main content by a `{colors.hairline}` top border. Links use `{typography.link}` in `{colors.body}`, darkening to `{colors.ink}` on hover. Padding is generous at `{spacing.section}` top and bottom, with content arranged in a multi-column grid for desktop and a single column on mobile.

## Responsive Behavior

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile | < 744px | Single-column product grid; nav collapses to hamburger menu; search bar moves to full-width below nav; footer stacks vertically; buttons go full-width; hero section reduces padding |
| Tablet | 744–1128px | Two-column product grid; nav shows limited links (Shop, About) with hamburger for rest; search bar remains in nav but shrinks; footer uses 2-column layout |
| Desktop | 1128–1440px | Three-column product grid; full nav with all links visible; search bar in nav; footer uses 4-column layout; max-width container at 1128px |
| Wide | > 1440px | Four-column product grid; same nav layout; content max-width at 1440px with centered alignment; larger whitespace margins |

### Touch Targets
- All interactive elements (buttons, links, inputs) maintain a minimum 44px height for touch accessibility.
- Product cards have a minimum tap area of 120px x 120px for the image region.
- Filter tags and badges are at least 32px tall with 14px horizontal padding.
- Nav links have a minimum 44px tap area, even when text is smaller.

### Collapsing Strategy
- Primary navigation collapses to a hamburger menu at < 744px, with a slide-out drawer.
- Product grid columns reduce from 4 to 1 as viewport narrows.
- Footer multi-column layout collapses to a single column at < 744px.
- Search bar transitions from inline (desktop) to full-width below the nav (mobile).
- Hero section padding reduces from `{spacing.section}` on desktop to `{spacing.xl}` on mobile.

## Known Gaps

- **Hover states:** Extracted only from static CSS; interactive hover/focus/active states for all components may differ from what's documented here. Button hover colors are inferred from the primary-active token.
- **Error styling:** Form error messages, validation states, and error page designs were not extractable from the live site. The `text-input-error` border color is an educated guess based on the red accent.
- **Dark mode:** No dark mode detected on the live site. All colors assume a light theme on `{colors.canvas}` (#f5f5f5).
- **Typography scale:** Font sizes and weights are inferred from common patterns on the site and may not match every page. The brand uses system fonts, so exact sizing may vary by browser.
- **Spacing scale:** The spacing tokens are a best-guess reconstruction from layout measurements; the actual system may use a different base unit or custom values.
- **Component variants:** Only the most common component states are documented. Missing: loading spinners, skeleton screens, toast notifications, modal dialogs, and dropdown menus.
- **Color usage:** The extracted palette includes several accent colors (rose, sage, navy, red, blue, green) that appear on the site but may have specific, undocumented usage rules. The navy `#3a5792` and blue `#7bb1ff` may be third-party widget colors rather than brand colors.
- **Animation:** No animation timing, easing curves, or transition durations were extractable. The brand likely uses subtle transitions (0.2s ease) but this is unconfirmed.
- **Checkout flow:** Shopify checkout is a separate, hosted system with its own design tokens. This document covers only the storefront.
