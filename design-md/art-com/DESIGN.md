description: Millions of prints compete for the eye on the same white canvas, so the interface earns its keep by receding — neutral grays (#404040, #595959, #737373) carry body copy while catalog imagery does the personality work. The one moment the brand asserts itself is at the call-to-action: a flat crimson (#bd2426) fires on every "Add to Cart" and checkout button, drawing the eye without competing with a Klimt or a Warhol in the adjacent thumbnail. Deep navy (#163959) anchors the top utility bar, category headers, and editorial rail labels, giving hierarchy to a system that otherwise runs entirely on system typography — Arial and Helvetica Neue at modest weights, staying visibly out of the art's way. Radius work is conservative throughout: product cards and input fields use {rounded.xs} corners rather than the pill geometry of lifestyle brands, reinforcing the catalog-department-store sensibility over boutique warmth. The badge system is color-coded and compact — warm orange (#f68b1f) signals "Best Seller," fresh green (#9bca3e) marks new arrivals, and sale pricing inherits the primary crimson, all rendered at 11px uppercase type against white card faces. Link affordances use a standard web blue (#0051c3) with no branded deviation, a deliberate choice that keeps navigation legible without pulling focus from product thumbnails. The page grid is image-forward at every breakpoint: a responsive masonry of square thumbnails, a horizontal-scroll rail for editorial picks, and a dark (#272727) footer that collapses into accordions on mobile. The overall visual language is high-volume and image-forward, trusting the art to supply the personality that the brand interface deliberately withholds.

## Components

### Buttons

**`button-primary`** — Flat crimson (#bd2426) with uppercase white type at 15px/700 weight and a conservative {rounded.xs} corner radius, used for every cart, checkout, and primary conversion action. Hover and active states step down to the dark maroon {colors.primary-active} (#521010); the disabled state uses the washed pink {colors.primary-disabled} (#de5052) with no opacity fade. Height holds at 44px to maintain a consistent CTA footprint across the catalog grid.

**`button-secondary`** — White fill with a 2px crimson border and matching crimson type, carrying the same {rounded.xs} and uppercase {typography.button-md}. Used for "Save to Collection," wishlist actions, and secondary CTAs where a ghost outline keeps the art-first canvas visible behind the interaction layer.

**`button-tertiary`** — Neutral canvas fill with a 1px {colors.hairline-strong} border and {colors.body} text at {typography.button-sm}. Appears on filter toggles, sort controls, and low-hierarchy shelf actions.

### Search

**`search-bar`** — A horizontal input at 40px height with a 1px {colors.hairline-strong} border and a flush right-side submit button block in {colors.secondary} navy. The search button carries a white icon; on input focus the border upgrades to 2px navy. Autocomplete suggestions drop below in a white panel with {rounded.xs} corners and {typography.body-sm} suggestion rows, artist and subject grouped into labeled sections.

### Product Card

**`product-card`** — A square 1:1 image container with a 1px {colors.hairline} border and no drop shadow at rest. Title renders in {typography.body-sm} at {colors.ink} below the image; price in {typography.price-sm} in {colors.primary} crimson. On hover, a subtle `box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.12)` lifts the card without scaling the image. Badge overlays ({badge-bestseller}, {badge-sale}, {badge-new}) pin to the top-left corner of the image area.

### Navigation

**`nav-bar-top`** — A 32px utility strip in {colors.secondary} navy (#163959) holding promotional copy, help links, and account/sign-in shortcuts in 12px white type. Sits above the main nav and is the first brand color a visitor sees.

**`nav-bar`** — White bar at 60px height with a 1px {colors.hairline} bottom border. Logo sits left; centered search bar occupies the middle column; cart count badge, account, and favorites icons anchor right. Category labels expand into full-width mega-menu panels on hover, presenting subcategory grids with thumbnail previews.

### Badges

**`badge-bestseller`** — Warm orange (#f68b1f) fill with white uppercase 11px type, {rounded.xs}, pinned to the image top-left. The orange reads warm and promotional without alarm.

**`badge-sale`** — Crimson (#bd2426) fill matching the primary action color, providing strong reinforcement that a price has been reduced. Paired with a {price-original} strikethrough on the card below.

**`badge-new`** — Fresh green (#9bca3e) fill with {colors.ink} dark text, differentiating new arrivals from promotions in the color-coded badge vocabulary.

### Hero Banner

**`hero-banner`** — Full-width navy (#163959) panel with large white headline at {typography.display-xl}. Campaign heroes layer a full-bleed photograph over the navy base with a semi-transparent overlay ensuring text legibility. A single {button-primary} CTA sits left-aligned or centered below body copy at {typography.body-md}.

### Editorial Rail

**`editorial-rail`** — A {colors.surface-soft} (#f5f5f5) section with a {typography.category-label} uppercase label in {colors.secondary} navy above a horizontally scrollable row of {product-card} tiles. Used for "Trending Now," "Editor's Picks," and artist spotlights. The navy label creates a visual anchor that separates editorial context from the open catalog grid above and below.

### Category Header

**`category-header`** — White background with a large {typography.display-md} heading and a 2px {colors.hairline} rule below. A {typography.category-label} uppercase subtitle in {colors.secondary} sits above the main heading for breadcrumb-style context. Used at the top of every browse and search results page.

### Breadcrumb

**`breadcrumb`** — {typography.caption} in {colors.muted-soft} gray, "/" separator, with the active (current page) segment in {colors.body}. Sits below the nav-bar and above the category-header on product detail and browse pages.

### Price Display

**`price-display`** — Current prices render in {colors.primary} crimson at {typography.price} weight 700, making the price a visual signal that rhymes with the add-to-cart button. Where a sale applies, the original price appears immediately to the right or below in {typography.price-sm} with `text-decoration: line-through` at {colors.muted}.

### Footer

**`footer`** — A full-width {colors.ink} (#272727) footer with four columns on desktop: About, Help, Browse, and Connect. Column headings in {typography.title-sm} in {colors.hairline} gray; links in {typography.body-sm} in slightly lighter {colors.hairline}. Legal copy and copyright sit on a separate bottom row in {typography.caption}. Link color uses {colors.hairline} for readability against the dark background without competing with the page content above.

## Responsive Behavior

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile | < 744px | Single-column product grid; search bar moves to a full-width row below the logo strip; top utility nav collapses into the hamburger drawer; hero banner reduces to 220px tall; footer columns become tap-to-expand accordions; editorial rails shift to horizontal scroll carousels |
| Tablet | 744–1128px | Two-to-three column product grid; mega-menu replaced by a left slide-in drawer; search bar retains inline position in the nav; category pills appear as a horizontally scrollable strip below the nav |
| Desktop | 1128–1440px | Four-column product grid; full mega-menu dropdowns on nav hover; hero at 360px min-height; footer renders all four columns inline |
| Wide | > 1440px | Container max-width centers at ~1440px; product grid stays at four columns with increased gutters; hero may use extended full-bleed image with centered content block |

### Touch Targets

- All primary and secondary buttons maintain 44px minimum tap height
- Nav icon buttons (cart, account, search toggle) use 44×44px hit areas regardless of visual icon size
- Category pills on mobile use minimum 36px height with sufficient horizontal padding
- Search input field renders at 44px tall on mobile to prevent iOS auto-zoom on focus
- Breadcrumb links pad to at least 32px touch height on mobile via increased vertical padding

### Collapsing Strategy

- Mega-menu navigation collapses to a hamburger icon on tablet and below; drawer slides from the left with a full category tree and back-navigation
- The top navy utility bar collapses into the hamburger drawer on mobile; a dismissible promo banner may surface its most important message at the top of the page
- Badge and price information on product cards remain visible at all breakpoints; artist name truncates to one line with ellipsis on narrow cards
- Editorial rails switch from a static multi-column grid to a horizontal scroll carousel on mobile, preserving card size rather than shrinking content
- Footer four-column grid reflows to stacked sections with disclosure accordions; legal links remain a single inline row at the very bottom

## Known Gaps

- Site was served behind Cloudflare bot protection at extraction time; page title returned "Attention Required! | Cloudflare" — no live DOM, rendered component markup, or computed CSS was captured
- Exact primary font is unknown; extraction yielded only system stacks (Arial, Helvetica Neue, -apple-system); Art.com may use a licensed typeface not visible in static assets
- No confirmed border-radius values from live components — {rounded.xs}/{rounded.sm} values are inferred from the utilitarian catalog style, not measured
- No spacing or grid measurements extracted; container widths, column gutters, and section padding are approximated from the scale and category of the site
- Button height, padding, and exact CTA color treatment could not be confirmed from live product detail or cart flow pages
- Several extracted colors (#bada7a, #516b1d, #9bca3e, #bada7a) may belong to a specific promotional campaign or seasonal theme rather than the evergreen brand palette
- Dark-mode or alternate-theme variants are unknown — no @media prefers-color-scheme rules were captured
- Mega-menu structure, column counts, and thumbnail dimensions in navigation panels could not be confirmed without live DOM access
- Cart and checkout flow component styling (order summary, address forms, payment inputs) entirely unconfirmed
