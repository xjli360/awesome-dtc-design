description: A deep teal #108474 anchors every primary action across Balolo's wood-and-workspace ecosystem — a color pulled from the heart of a forest rather than a tech dashboard, appearing on add-to-cart buttons, navigation highlights, and the brand's signature monitor-stand risers. The palette runs through a meticulous grayscale gradient (#1a1a1a for ink, #7b7b7b for body text, #b1b1b1 for muted, #dedede for hairline, #f9fafb for canvas) with a warm undertow in #f5f2ee and #cbc0ac that echoes natural wood tones without being literal. Plus Jakarta Sans carries the typography at moderate weights — display headlines sit at 500–600 rather than aggressive 700s, letting the product photography of walnut and oak grain do the heavy lifting. Cards use {rounded.sm} corners, buttons use {rounded.sm}, and the search bar uses {rounded.full}, creating a system that feels precise and workshop-crafted rather than playful. The brand's trust signal — a 4.8-star Judge.me badge — appears in {rounded.xs} pills with the extracted #108474 as its accent, and every product card floats on {surface-card} white with a {hairline} border that reads like a blueprint edge. This is a system built for clarity: the teal is the only color that ever feels like a decision, and everything else steps back to let the wood grain and the workspace function lead.

## Components

### Buttons
**`button-primary`** — The primary call-to-action across the site, filled with the brand's deep teal #108474. Used for "Add to Cart", "Checkout", and primary form submissions. On hover, shifts to `{button-primary-active}` with #0d6b5d. Disabled state uses `{button-primary-disabled}` with #b8d9d4, maintaining the same 8px rounded corners and 44px height.

**`button-secondary`** — An outlined or ghost-style button on white canvas, used for "Learn More", "View Details", and secondary actions. Text is ink #1a1a1a with a 1px hairline border. On hover, the background fills with `{surface-soft}` #f5f2ee.

**`button-tertiary-text`** — A text-only button in primary teal, used for inline links like "Read Reviews" or "See All". No background, no border — just the teal text with underline on hover.

### Cards
**`product-card`** — The core product display unit, a white card with 8px rounded corners and a subtle 1px hairline border. Contains a product image with matching 8px rounded corners, a title in `{title-sm}`, and a price in `{body-sm}` at #7b7b7b. The card has no shadow — the brand relies on clean borders and whitespace rather than elevation.

**`badge-pill`** — A small, fully rounded pill in primary teal, used for "Best Seller", "New", or "4.8★" trust badges. Text is white, padding is 4px 12px. A secondary variant `{badge-pill-wood}` uses the warm #efece6 background with ink text for material-specific tags like "Walnut" or "Oak".

### Navigation
**`nav-bar`** — A 72px sticky header on white canvas, containing the logo, product category links in `{nav-link}`, a search bar pill, and a cart icon. On scroll, compresses to 60px. Active nav links are underlined in primary teal.

**`search-bar-pill`** — A fully rounded search input on #f5f2ee background, 44px tall, with placeholder text in #b1b1b1. On focus, the background shifts to white with a primary teal border.

### Forms
**`text-input`** — Standard text input fields on #f9fafb canvas, 44px tall with 8px rounded corners and 12px 16px padding. On focus, the border changes to primary teal. Used for email signup, contact forms, and checkout fields.

### Footer
**`footer-link`** — Standard link in #7b7b7b body text, no underline. On hover, turns primary teal. The footer is organized in columns with section headers in `{caption}` uppercase.

## Responsive Behavior

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile | < 744px | Single-column product grid (1 card wide), nav collapses to hamburger menu, hero text reduces to `{display-md}`, search bar moves to drawer |
| Tablet | 744–1128px | Two-column product grid, nav shows top-level links only, search bar remains visible but compresses |
| Desktop | 1128–1440px | Three-column product grid, full nav with all links, search bar at full width |
| Wide | > 1440px | Four-column product grid, max-width container at 1440px, centered layout |

### Touch Targets
- All buttons and interactive elements minimum 44px height
- Nav links minimum 40px tap area
- Search bar pill minimum 44px height
- Product card tap target is the entire card surface

### Collapsing Strategy
- Navigation collapses to hamburger menu at < 744px
- Product grid collapses from 4-column to 1-column at mobile
- Footer columns collapse to single column at < 744px
- Hero section reduces padding from 64px to 32px at mobile

## Known Gaps

- Extracted colors are heavily weighted toward grayscale tones — the brand's true primary #108474 appears only once in the extracted list, suggesting it may be used sparingly or the extraction missed some pages. The remaining colors (#eeeeee, #f9fafb, #7b7b7b, etc.) form a clean grayscale system but lack the distinctive teal presence one would expect from a brand using it as primary.
- Font-family extraction returned "JudgemeStar" (a review-widget font) and "Plus Jakarta Sans" with some duplication. The actual brand font may include additional weights (e.g., 700 for display) not captured.
- Hover states for buttons, links, and cards are inferred from common patterns — actual transitions (ease, duration) not extracted.
- Error states for form inputs (red borders, error messages) not captured.
- Dark mode not present on the live site — no dark palette available.
- Sub-brand or collection-specific color variations (e.g., limited editions) not extracted.
- Spacing values are estimated from common patterns — actual padding/margin values may vary by component.
- No extracted data for modal, tooltip, or dropdown component styling.
