description: A children's bookstore that wears its global, story-first soul on its sleeve through a high-voltage primary of #e53624 — a stop-sign red that reads as warmth and urgency, not danger — and a secondary pulse of #003399, a deep trusty blue that grounds every navigation bar and footer. The palette is deliberately un-muted: #98d108 (lime), #33cccc (teal), #f58229 (orange), and #785ba7 (violet) appear as badge fills, age-category tags, and illustrated-element accents, giving the site the feel of a picture-book spread where every page turn reveals a new color. The canvas is #f9f9f9 rather than pure white, softening the reading experience, while #efefef and #dadada provide hairline and surface-soft tones that keep the layout airy. Typography runs Lora for display and body — a serif with calligraphic warmth that signals "read aloud" rather than "scan quickly" — and Roboto for UI labels and buttons, creating a deliberate tension between storybook elegance and functional clarity. Buttons use {rounded.full} pill shapes, softening the intensity of the red primary, while product cards use {rounded.md} to feel approachable without being childish. The search bar, category filters, and age-group badges all sit on {rounded.full} or {rounded.sm} containers, making every interactive element feel tactile and safe for small hands. The overall mood is generous, slightly handmade, and unafraid of color — a digital space that mirrors the physical bookstore's wooden shelves, woven rugs, and open story-time circle.

## Components

### Buttons
**`button-primary`** — The primary call-to-action across the site, rendered as a pill-shaped button in the brand's signature red (#e53624). Used for "Add to Cart," "Shop Now," and primary checkout actions. On hover, it shifts to `{colors.primary-active}` (#c92e1e) for a subtle darkening effect. The disabled state uses `{colors.primary-disabled}` (#f3a39c) with reduced opacity, ensuring users can still perceive the button's presence without interactivity.

**`button-secondary`** — An outlined or filled white button with red text, used for secondary actions like "Learn More" or "View Details." The outline variant (`button-secondary-outline`) uses a 2px solid border in `{colors.primary}` and transparent background, while the filled variant uses `{colors.canvas}` background. Both maintain the full pill shape and 48px height for consistency with the primary button.

**`button-pill-accent`** — A smaller, accent-colored pill button used for promotional banners, newsletter signups, or age-group-specific calls. Uses `{colors.accent-teal}` (#33cccc) as its primary background, creating a friendly, non-red alternative for less urgent actions. Height is 40px with tighter padding.

### Badges & Tags
**`product-card-badge`** — A small, marigold-yellow (#ffdf66) badge positioned at the top-left corner of product cards. Uses uppercase Roboto at 11px with 0.5px letter-spacing. Used to denote "Award Winner," "Staff Pick," or "New Arrival" status. The badge sits on a slightly rounded rectangle (`{rounded.sm}`) with 4px/8px padding.

**`age-badge`** — A pill-shaped badge indicating the recommended age range for a book. The base color is `{colors.accent-lime}` (#98d108) for the 3-7 age group, with distinct colors for other ranges: teal (#33cccc) for 0-3, orange (#f58229) for 7-11, and violet (#785ba7) for 11+. Each badge uses uppercase Roboto at 11px with tight tracking, ensuring readability at small sizes.

**`badge-new`** and **`badge-sale`** — Two additional badge variants for promotional labeling. `badge-new` uses a deep red (#e03626) for "New" indicators, while `badge-sale` uses a bright orange (#ff8400) for discount markers. Both follow the same typography and rounded-rectangle shape as `product-card-badge`.

### Navigation
**`nav-bar`** — A fixed or sticky top navigation bar at 72px height on a `{colors.canvas}` (#f9f9f9) background. Contains the brand logo, primary navigation links (Books, Gifts, About, Blog), a search icon, and a cart icon. Links use uppercase Roboto at 15px with 0.3px letter-spacing. On scroll, a subtle box-shadow (`0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)`) appears to separate the nav from content.

**`nav-link`** — Individual navigation links with 8px/16px padding. The active state is indicated by a 2px bottom border in `{colors.primary}` and red text color. Inactive links remain in `{colors.ink}` (#1a1a1a). Hover state adds a light background tint from `{colors.surface-soft}`.

**`category-pill`** — Filter pills used in the category strip below the hero section. Each pill is a fully rounded button in `{colors.surface-soft}` (#efefef) with dark body text. The active state fills with `{colors.primary}` and white text, creating a clear visual distinction. Used for filtering by category (Adventure, Folktales, Nature, etc.) or by age group.

### Cards
**`product-card`** — The primary content card for displaying books. A white (`{colors.surface-card}`) background with `{rounded.md}` (12px) corners. The card image occupies the top portion with rounded top corners only, creating a natural visual hierarchy. Below the image, the title uses `{typography.title-md}` (Lora 18px, semibold), the author uses `{typography.body-sm}` (Roboto 14px, muted gray), and the price uses `{typography.title-sm}` (Roboto 16px, uppercase, in primary red). Padding is 16px on sides, with 8px between elements.

**`hero-section`** — A full-width hero area with a coral/pink background (`{colors.accent-coral}` #f9eae7). Contains a large Lora heading (`{typography.display-xl}` at 36px) and a body-Lora subheading at 18px. Padding is 64px on top/bottom and 32px on sides. The hero may include an illustration or photograph on the right side, with the text block on the left.

### Forms & Inputs
**`text-input`** — Standard text input fields used in search, newsletter signup, and checkout forms. A white background (`{colors.surface-card}`) with `{rounded.sm}` (8px) corners and 12px/16px padding. On focus, the border changes to `{colors.primary}` (#e53624) with a 2px stroke. Height is 48px for consistency with buttons.

**`search-bar`** — A dedicated search input with a pill shape (`{rounded.full}`) and 52px height. Uses a white background with 12px/24px padding. A search icon in `{colors.muted}` (#666666) sits on the left side. On focus, the border transitions to `{colors.primary}`. The search bar may include a subtle placeholder text in `{colors.muted-soft}`.

### Footer
**`footer`** — A deep blue footer section on `{colors.footer-bg}` (#003399) with white text. Contains four columns: About Us, Customer Service, Connect, and a Newsletter signup. Links are in white at 85% opacity with Lora 16px. Column headings use uppercase Roboto at 16px with 700 weight. Padding is 64px on top/bottom and 32px on sides. The footer includes a copyright bar at the bottom with reduced opacity.

### Star Rating
**`star-rating`** — A 5-star rating display using orange (#ff9635) stars at 16px. Used on product cards and review sections. Stars are filled or empty based on the rating value, with half-star support. The component sits between the author and price on product cards.

## Responsive Behavior

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile | < 744px | Single-column layout; nav collapses to hamburger menu; product cards stack vertically; hero text centered; category pills wrap to 2 columns; footer stacks to single column |
| Tablet | 744–1128px | 2-column product grid; nav links visible but condensed; hero maintains side-by-side layout; category pills in a horizontal scrollable strip; footer in 2 columns |
| Desktop | 1128–1440px | 3-column product grid; full nav bar with all links; hero with text left, image right; category pills fully visible; footer in 4 columns |
| Wide | > 1440px | 4-column product grid; max-width container (1440px) centered; hero content max-width 1200px; additional whitespace on sides |

### Touch Targets
- All interactive elements (buttons, links, pills) have a minimum height of 44px and width of 44px for touch accessibility
- Category pills and age badges are at least 40px tall with 20px horizontal padding
- Search bar is 52px tall for easy thumb access
- Nav links have 48px touch areas (8px padding + 32px text height)
- Product card images are tappable with a minimum 120px height on mobile

### Collapsing Strategy
- On mobile, the top navigation collapses to a hamburger menu with a slide-out drawer; the brand logo remains centered
- The category filter strip becomes horizontally scrollable with snap points on mobile, hiding overflow pills
- Product cards collapse from a 3-column grid to a single column on mobile, with full-width images
- The hero section reduces padding from 64px to 32px on mobile, and the image may stack below the text
- The footer collapses from 4 columns to 1 column on mobile, with accordion-style expandable sections for each category
- Age badges on product cards may be hidden on mobile to save space, with age info shown in the product detail view

## Known Gaps

- Hover and focus states for most components could not be reliably extracted; the active states provided are inferred from common patterns
- Error styling for form inputs (validation errors, required field indicators) was not visible in the extracted data
- Dark mode is not supported by the current site; no dark-mode tokens are defined
- The exact font weights for Lora (400, 600, 700) and Roboto (400, 600, 700) are inferred from common usage; the site may use additional weights
- Sub-brand or seasonal color palettes (e.g., holiday themes, special collections) were not captured
- The checkout flow colors may include Shopify Pay, Klarna, or Afterpay widget colors that were not filtered from the extracted hex list; the palette focuses on the brand's own UI
- Animation durations, easing curves, and transition properties were not extractable
- The exact spacing values for component padding and margins are estimated based on common patterns; the site may use a different spacing scale
- Accessibility contrast ratios for text on colored backgrounds (e.g., white text on #e53624) should be verified against WCAG standards
- The extracted hex list includes #cfcfcf, #147378, #f98b25, and #ffdf66 which may be used in illustrations or photography rather than UI elements; they are included as accent possibilities but may not be active design tokens
