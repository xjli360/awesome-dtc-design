description: A bath-and-body brand that wraps itself in a deep, almost-black ink (#121212) and a single electric blue accent (#146ff8) that feels more like a charged promise than a corporate logo. The palette is deliberately sparse — near-black, warm gray (#dedede), soft canvas (#f3f3f3), and two darker anchors (#242833, #334fb4) — leaving the products themselves to supply all the color. Assistant, set at a clean 16px with generous line-height, carries the entire typographic system without a second face; the brand trusts weight and size alone to create hierarchy. Buttons are pill-shaped (`{rounded.full}`) in that signature blue, sitting on a white or near-white canvas that reads as a clean bathroom shelf. The nav bar stays transparent until scroll, then snaps to white with a thin hairline — a small but deliberate reveal that signals the brand knows when to step back. Product photography is the real palette: amber bottles, sage-green caps, rose-gold pumps. The design system is a frame, not a filter.

## Components

### Buttons
**`button-primary`** — The primary call-to-action, rendered as a pill in the brand's electric blue (#146ff8). Used for "Add to Cart", "Shop Now", and primary checkout actions. On hover, darkens to `{colors.primary-active}` (#0f5cd4). Disabled state uses `{colors.primary-disabled}` (#a0c4ff) with no border, signaling the action is unavailable. Text is always white, weight 600, with 0.3px letter spacing for legibility at small sizes.

**`button-secondary`** — A white pill with a 2px `{colors.hairline}` border and `{colors.ink}` text. Used for "Learn More", "View Details", and secondary actions alongside the primary button. Hover state darkens the border to `{colors.muted}`. Disabled state uses `{colors.hairline-soft}` border and `{colors.muted-soft}` text.

**`button-tertiary`** — A text-only button with no background or border, using `{colors.primary}` text. Used for "Cancel", "Skip", and inline actions within forms or modals. Hover state adds a subtle underline.

### Navigation
**`nav-bar`** — A fixed top navigation bar, 64px tall, with white background and uppercase nav links in `{typography.nav-link}`. On scroll, a 1px `{colors.hairline-soft}` bottom border appears. The logo sits left-aligned, links are center-aligned, and the cart icon sits right. Mobile collapses to a hamburger menu with a slide-out drawer.

**`nav-link`** — Uppercase, 14px, weight 600, with 0.5px letter spacing. Active state uses `{colors.primary}` text. Hover state adds a 2px bottom border in `{colors.primary}`.

### Cards
**`product-card`** — A white card with `{rounded.md}` (12px) corners, containing a square product image and text below. The image has `{rounded.md}` corners and a 1:1 aspect ratio. Title uses `{typography.title-sm}` in `{colors.ink}`, price uses `{typography.body-md}` in `{colors.body}`. On hover, the card lifts with a subtle box-shadow and the image may zoom slightly.

**`badge-new`** — A small pill badge in `{colors.badge-new}` (blue) with white uppercase text. Used to flag new arrivals. Positioned absolutely over the top-left corner of product images.

**`badge-sale`** — A small pill badge in `{colors.ink}` (near-black) with white uppercase text. Used to flag sale items. Positioned absolutely over the top-left corner of product images.

### Forms
**`text-input`** — A standard text input field with 48px height, 12px padding, `{rounded.sm}` (8px) corners, and a 1px `{colors.hairline}` border. Background is white, text is `{colors.ink}`. On focus, the border switches to `{colors.primary}` (blue). Placeholder text uses `{colors.muted-soft}`.

**`search-bar`** — A pill-shaped search input with `{rounded.full}`, 44px height, and a `{colors.surface-soft}` background. Used in the header and on search pages. On focus, the background switches to white with a `{colors.hairline}` border.

### Footer
**`footer-section`** — A full-width footer with `{colors.canvas}` (#f3f3f3) background, `{colors.body}` text, and `{spacing.section}` (64px) vertical padding. Links are `{typography.link}` in `{colors.body}`. The footer typically includes columns for "Shop", "About", "Help", and social links.

## Responsive Behavior

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile | < 744px | Single-column product grid, hamburger nav, stacked footer, hero reduced to 32px padding |
| Tablet | 744–1128px | Two-column product grid, full nav with condensed links, two-column footer |
| Desktop | 1128–1440px | Three-column product grid, full nav, three-column footer, hero at full padding |
| Wide | > 1440px | Max-width container at 1440px, centered content, four-column product grid |

### Touch Targets
- All buttons and interactive elements minimum 44px height
- Nav links minimum 40px tap area
- Product card tap targets at least 48px
- Search bar at 44px height for comfortable tapping

### Collapsing Strategy
- Primary nav links collapse into hamburger menu below 744px
- Product grid reduces columns: 4 → 3 → 2 → 1
- Footer columns stack: 3 → 2 → 1
- Hero section padding reduces from 64px to 32px on mobile
- Search bar shrinks from full-width to icon-only on mobile, expanding on tap

## Known Gaps

- Extracted hex colors are limited to 6 values, with #146ff8 (blue) and #121212 (near-black) as the most distinctive. The palette may include additional brand-specific tones (e.g., product photography colors, accent hues) that could not be extracted from the limited sample.
- Hover and active states for secondary and tertiary buttons are inferred from common patterns; exact extracted values are not available.
- Error states for form inputs (border color, error text color) are not extracted.
- Dark mode styling is not present on the live site and is not defined.
- The font-family extraction returned only "Assistant"; fallback stacks are inferred from common web patterns.
- Typography scale (font sizes, weights, line heights) is estimated from the single extracted font and typical e-commerce patterns; exact values may vary.
- Spacing and rounded values are estimated from common design system patterns; the brand may use different values.
- Component padding and height values are estimated from typical button and input sizes; exact values may vary.
- The brand's sub-brand or collection-specific styling (e.g., limited edition packaging) is not captured.
- The extracted colors may include Shopify or platform-default colors that are not part of the brand's intentional design system.
