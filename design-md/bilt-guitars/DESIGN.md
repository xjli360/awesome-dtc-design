description: Every instrument at Bilt begins as a blank configuration — the site is structured around a spec-builder, not a fixed catalog, which means the UI must simultaneously hold the intimacy of a lutherie conversation and the precision of a parts manifest. The canvas is near-black, running from #110c1d at the deepest hero moments to #1a1230 in panel backgrounds, a darkness that evokes the velvet interior of a hard-shell case rather than a generic dark-mode treatment. Against this field, the brand's primary action color is a deep navy #003388 — a restrained choice that carries every call-to-action ("Start Building," "Add to Cart," spec confirmation) while resisting the excitability of the brighter colors elsewhere in the extracted palette.

  The accent system runs two deliberate temperatures. Warm amber (#a88548) marks wood-selection callouts and material labels, mapping visually to the maple tops and mahogany backs photographed in product previews — a color that smells like a workshop. Electric green (#00d084) is reserved exclusively for selection-confirmed state inside the configurator: option swatches glow with a faint rgba wash and a 2px border in that color at `{rounded.xs}`, making the "you chose this" signal unmissable even on near-black surfaces where standard focus rings disappear. The pairing of these two accent temperatures against the dark canvas creates a visual language closer to workshop instrumentation than to a retail storefront.

  Type is set in gdsherpa, an uncommon face that carries condensed authority at display sizes and stays legible as a spec label at 11px uppercase with tracking. Button text runs uppercase, reinforcing the precision-spec register. Rounded corners are held deliberately tight — `{rounded.xs}` on interactive elements, `{rounded.sm}` on cards — keeping every surface angular enough to feel machined rather than lifestyle-softened. The configurator's option grids run on dense `{spacing.sm}` gutters that breathe out to `{spacing.section}` between major content bands, giving the hero room to photograph each body silhouette in full while keeping the builder UI compact and scannable.

  Flashes of violet (#7a00df, #ab1dfe) and cyan (#34e2e4, #31cdcf) appear in the extracted palette but almost certainly belong to WordPress Gutenberg block-editor defaults or one-off promotional overlays rather than the core brand system; they are noted in Known Gaps and excluded from primary tokens.

## Components

### Buttons

**`button-primary`** — Navy (#003388) fill at 48px tall with `{rounded.xs}` corners and uppercase gdsherpa at 14px/700/0.8px tracking; this is the workshop-spec register, not a lifestyle CTA. Hover state deepens to #020381 (`primary-active`); a disabled state shifts to the lighter #256bed with reduced opacity. The `button-primary-lg` variant at 56px height and 16px type is used for the hero's singular "Start Building" action, where it needs to read clearly against a full-bleed instrument photo.

**`button-secondary`** — A transparent-fill button with a 1px white border on dark surfaces, holding the same 48px height and uppercase treatment as the primary. Designed to appear beside the primary on hero and product-detail sections where two actions coexist — "Build" and "View Specs" — without one overwhelming the other. On light-canvas sections the border color inherits `{colors.ink}`.

**`button-ghost-gold`** — A smaller 36px ghost button in amber (#a88548) used in material-selection and wood-preview contexts. Its gold border against the dark surface echoes the warmth of the instrument photography and reinforces the material-callout register without competing with the primary navy CTA.

### Text Input

**`text-input`** — Inputs sit on the surface-darkest (#110c1d) ground with a 1px muted border at `{rounded.xs}`, standing 48px tall to match button targets for visual rhythm. Placeholder text renders in muted (#444444); focus state sharpens the border to the primary navy (#003388) — a subtle but clear active signal against the dark field. The form is intentionally minimal and unstyled beyond this: Bilt's contact and lead-capture forms are brief, treating the configurator as the primary interaction rather than a shopping cart.

### Nav Bar

**`nav-bar`** — A 64px-tall fixed header on surface-darkest (#110c1d), separated from content by an 8%-white-alpha bottom border that is almost invisible but holds the layer separation on dark page sections. Navigation links run in `{typography.nav-link}` (14px/600/0.3px tracking) in on-dark white; the logo lockup anchors left; a `button-primary` CTA ("Build Your Guitar") sits at the right edge. On scroll, no background change — the header remains static in opacity and color because the page background is already dark.

### Product Card

**`product-card`** — Cards live on the surface-card ground (#32373c) with `{rounded.sm}` corners and 16px internal padding. The model name renders in `{typography.title-md}` (18px/600) in on-dark white; a two-line spec summary in `{typography.body-sm}` sits below in muted (#444444). A `spec-badge` in the card's lower corner labels the body style — Single Cut, Double Cut, Semi-hollow — giving the catalog grid a scannable taxonomy without additional UI chrome. The card image uses a 4:3 aspect ratio with `{rounded.xs}` corners, photographed against a neutral dark ground so the wood grain reads clearly.

### Hero

**`hero`** — Full-viewport-height section on surface-darkest (#110c1d) with a large studio silhouette or in-use instrument photograph filling the majority of the frame. The headline runs in `{typography.display-xl}` (48px/700/−1px tracking); a single-sentence sub-copy line in `{typography.body-md}` with hairline (#eeeeee) color sits below. One `button-primary-lg` ("Start Building") is the sole CTA — there are no carousels, no parallax, no competing links. The guitar's silhouette does the persuading; the headline names what it is.

### Configurator Panel

**`configurator-panel`** — The builder UI occupies a two-column layout: instrument preview left, option groups right. The option panel sits on surface-dark (#1a1230) with `{rounded.sm}` corners, 24px internal padding, and a faint 8%-white-alpha border to lift it visually off the page ground. Each option group carries a `{typography.spec-label}` heading in amber (#a88548) — "BODY STYLE," "FINISH," "PICKUPS," "NECK" — followed by a grid of `option-swatch` chips. Group spacing is `{spacing.lg}` between categories and `{spacing.sm}` between individual swatches.

### Option Swatches

**`option-swatch`** — 32px square chips at `{rounded.xs}`, containing either a material thumbnail (wood grain, finish photo, hardware close-up) or a text label for non-visual options. Unselected state shows a 1px muted border; selected state transitions to a 2px electric-green (#00d084) border with a `{colors.selection-wash}` background tint — rgba(0,208,132,0.12). Because this green appears nowhere else in the UI, selection state is impossible to confuse with hover or focus. Swatches expand to 44px minimum on touch viewports.

### Spec Badges

**`spec-badge`** — Rectangular labels with no border-radius (`{rounded.none}`), amber (#a88548) text on surface-darkest (#110c1d), framed by a 1px amber border. Typography is `{typography.spec-label}` (11px/700/uppercase/1px tracking). Used to label body style, scale length, and pickup configuration in catalog grids and on product cards. The zero-radius treatment is intentional — badges should read like data tags stamped on a parts bin, not like lifestyle chips.

### Category Filter

**`category-filter`** — Small inline filter pills on transparent ground with a 1px muted border, rendered in `{typography.button-sm}`. Active state fills with primary navy (#003388) and shifts text to on-primary white. Used above catalog grids to filter by model family or body style. The `{rounded.xs}` corner matches all other interactive elements in the system.

### Footer

**`footer`** — Dark footer on surface-darkest (#110c1d) with a faint top border, body text in muted (#444444) at `{typography.body-sm}`, and nav links in on-dark white at the same scale. Three-column layout at desktop (About / Build / Legal), stacking to single column on mobile. Social icon links render in on-dark white at 24×24px; hover shifts to accent-electric (#00d084) — the only place the green appears outside of the configurator, connecting the "confirmed selection" energy to outbound links.

## Responsive Behavior

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile | < 744px | Single-column layout throughout; configurator stacks to preview above, option groups below as accordion; nav collapses to hamburger icon at 44×44px; hero headline drops to `display-md` (28px); option swatches expand to 44px touch targets; product grid at 1 column |
| Tablet | 744–1128px | Configurator shows two-column at tighter gutters; product card grid at 2 columns; nav shows primary links and hides secondary items; hero headline at `display-lg` (36px) |
| Desktop | 1128–1440px | Full two-column configurator with side-by-side preview and option panel; product grid at 3 columns; nav fully expanded with all links visible |
| Wide | > 1440px | Content max-width caps at 1440px with auto side margins; hero image scales to fill via object-fit cover with letter-box effect; product grid holds at 3 columns with wider card padding |

### Touch Targets

- Option swatches expand from 32px to 44px minimum on mobile and tablet
- Primary and secondary buttons maintain 48px height across all breakpoints
- Nav hamburger touch target is 44×44px with 8px padding on all sides
- Footer link rows gain 8px additional vertical padding on mobile for comfortable tapping
- Spec badges add 4px vertical padding on mobile to increase tap area

### Collapsing Strategy

- Configurator option groups collapse to an accordion by category on mobile; only one group is open at a time to avoid scroll depth
- Product grid: 3-col → 2-col → 1-col as viewport narrows
- Category filter strip switches from inline row to a horizontally scrollable strip on mobile; no line-wrapping
- Footer columns collapse to a single stacked list at mobile; social icons move to the top of the footer stack above the navigation links
- Nav bar height stays fixed at 64px across all breakpoints; the CTA button collapses to an icon-only state at mobile

## Known Gaps

- Violet (#7a00df, #ab1dfe) and cyan (#34e2e4, #31cdcf) in the extracted palette are likely WordPress Gutenberg block-editor color presets, not brand-owned UI tokens; their actual role in brand UI could not be confirmed
- The canvas background color was not extracted from the live site; #ffffff is assumed for light-mode page sections based on typical WordPress/Gutenberg templates
- No brand-published typography documentation exists for gdsherpa; all font-size, weight, line-height, and letter-spacing values are inferred from visual inspection rather than a design spec
- The exact configurator interaction model (linear step-by-step wizard vs. free-choice option picker) could not be determined from extracted data alone
- No confirmed spacing scale from the live site; values follow a standard 8px-base rhythm as a reasonable default
- Logo lockup proportions, exact wordmark font, and any secondary logomark treatment were not extractable
- Hover and focus animation timing (transition durations, easing) could not be extracted; values in components are structural only and do not specify animation
