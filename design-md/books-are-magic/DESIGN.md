name: Books Are Magic
description: A Brooklyn independent bookstore that uses a restrained palette of #0078a8 as its sole accent voltage — a deep, confident teal that appears on the primary navigation bar, the shopping-cart icon, and the footer background, while everything else stays in a grayscale of #222222, #777777, and #f4f4f4. The site runs Radikal, a Swiss-style sans-serif with seven weights from Light to Black Italic, giving the typography a sharp editorial clarity that feels more like a literary magazine than a retail storefront. Headlines sit in Radikal Black at generous sizes with tight tracking, while body copy uses Radikal Light for a surprising airiness — the brand trusts its book covers and event photography to carry emotional weight rather than relying on decorative type or illustration. The navigation is a single horizontal bar with dropdown menus for events and books, using {rounded.none} corners throughout except for the search bar which takes {rounded.full} pill shape and a subtle {colors.hairline} border. Product cards for books show cover art, title, author, and price in a clean three-column grid with {rounded.sm} corners on images and no box shadows — the covers themselves provide all the visual texture. The footer uses the teal #0078a8 as a full background with white text, creating a clear terminal signal that the page has ended. There are no badges, no sale flags, no star ratings — the design assumes visitors already know what they want or are willing to browse without persuasion.

## Components

### Buttons
**`button-primary`** — Solid teal (#0078a8) rectangle with uppercase Radikal Bold text in white. No border radius — the sharp corners reinforce the editorial Swiss aesthetic. On hover, darkens to #005f8a. Disabled state uses a desaturated light teal (#b3d4e3) with white text. Used for primary actions: "Add to Cart," "RSVP," "Subscribe."

**`button-secondary`** — White background with #222222 text and a 1px #c3c3c3 border. Same uppercase Radikal Bold treatment as primary. Hover fills the background with #f4f4f4. Used for secondary actions like "View Details" or "Learn More."

### Navigation
**`nav-bar`** — Full-width white bar at 64px height containing the store logo on the left and navigation links on the right. Links use Radikal Bold uppercase at 15px with 0.3px letter-spacing. On scroll, the bar shrinks to 56px and the background switches to teal (#0078a8) with white text — a dramatic transition that signals the user has entered the browsing experience. The logo remains in its original weight regardless of scroll state.

**`nav-link`** — Inline uppercase links with 8px horizontal padding. Hover state changes text color to teal (#0078a8). Active page uses teal text and a 2px bottom border in teal. No dropdown chevrons — the site uses simple expandable menus triggered on click.

### Search
**`search-bar`** — Pill-shaped input field with white background, 1px #c3c3c3 border, and Radikal Light 16px placeholder text. The pill shape is the only rounded element in the entire system, creating a deliberate visual contrast against the otherwise rectilinear design. Focus state swaps the border to teal (#0078a8). Includes a magnifying glass icon in #777777 on the left.

### Product Cards
**`product-card`** — Minimal book display with no card background or border — just the book cover image, title, author, and price stacked vertically. The cover image has 8px rounded corners ({rounded.sm}) while the text sits flush left. Title uses Radikal Bold 18px, author in Radikal Light 13px #777777, price in Radikal Regular 14px #222222. No hover effects, no add-to-cart button visible until the user clicks into the product detail page. The grid uses 3 columns on desktop, 2 on tablet, 1 on mobile.

### Footer
**`footer`** — Full teal (#0078a8) background section with white text, 48px vertical padding. Contains three columns: store information, quick links, and newsletter signup. Links use Radikal Regular 15px with hover state lightening to #c3c3c3. The newsletter input matches the search bar pill shape but with a white border and teal background — the only place where the color scheme inverts.

### Event Cards
**`event-card`** — Light gray (#f4f4f4) background rectangle with no border radius. Contains the event date in teal Radikal Bold 13px, event title in Radikal Bold 18px, and a short description in Radikal Light 14px #444444. A "RSVP" button sits at the bottom right. Events are listed in a single column with generous 24px spacing between cards.

### Hero Section
**`hero-section`** — Light gray (#f4f4f4) background section with 64px vertical padding. Contains a large headline (Radikal Black 40px), a subheading in Radikal Light 16px #777777, and optional CTA button. No background image — the hero relies on typographic weight and whitespace. Used on the homepage and category landing pages.

## Responsive Behavior

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile | < 744px | Single-column product grid; nav collapses to hamburger menu; hero font drops to 28px; footer stacks to single column; search bar moves to full-width below nav |
| Tablet | 744–1128px | Two-column product grid; nav links remain visible but with reduced padding; hero font at 32px; footer shows two columns |
| Desktop | 1128–1440px | Three-column product grid; full nav with all links; hero at 40px; footer three columns |
| Wide | > 1440px | Max-width container at 1280px centered; product grid remains three columns but with wider gutters |

### Touch Targets
- All buttons and links maintain minimum 44px tap target height
- Navigation links have 48px minimum tap area on mobile
- Search bar height stays at 44px across all breakpoints
- Cart icon button is 36px with 44px touch padding on mobile

### Collapsing Strategy
- Navigation collapses to hamburger icon below 744px
- Product grid reduces columns as viewport shrinks (3 → 2 → 1)
- Footer columns stack vertically below 744px
- Hero section reduces padding from 64px to 32px on mobile
- Search bar moves from inline nav position to full-width below nav on mobile
- Event cards remain single column at all breakpoints but reduce padding on mobile

## Known Gaps

- Hover and focus states for text inputs could not be reliably extracted — assumed teal border on focus based on brand color usage
- Error states for forms (validation, required fields) not observed on live site
- Dropdown menu styling for navigation sub-items not captured — likely uses simple white overlay with text links
- Mobile hamburger menu animation and overlay behavior not documented
- Product detail page layout (single book view with description, reviews, etc.) not fully extracted
- Checkout flow styling not available — site uses external payment processing
- Dark mode not supported by the brand
- Sub-brand or seasonal color variations not observed
- Loading states and skeleton screens not present on current site
- Print stylesheet behavior unknown
- Accessibility focus indicators not verified — assumed default browser outlines
- Newsletter confirmation/error states not captured
