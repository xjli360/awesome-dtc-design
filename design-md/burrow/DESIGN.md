description: Burrow is a furniture brand built on the conviction that good design should be both beautiful and functional, and that assembly should never require a tool. The brand's visual language is anchored in a warm, earthy palette that feels grounded yet refined — the primary voltage is a distinctive terracotta (#e46950) that appears on key CTAs, badges, and accent details, while the canvas is a soft, almost creamy off-white (#f7eee3) that avoids the sterility of pure white. Deep charcoal tones (#383633, #474543, #514f4d) provide the structural ink for body text and navigation, creating a strong contrast that feels substantial without being harsh. The system is punctuated by muted olive greens (#a9b199, #49574a) and dusty blues (#3a4b66, #3d4b64) that appear in product photography backgrounds and secondary accents, lending a natural, organic quality that echoes the brand's focus on modular, adaptable furniture. Typography relies on Suisse Intl, a clean geometric sans-serif that carries the brand's modern, unpretentious voice — it's used at moderate weights (400–600) with generous line-height, letting the furniture photography and generous whitespace do the heavy lifting. Rounded corners are soft but not pillowy: buttons use `{rounded.sm}` (8px), cards use `{rounded.md}` (12px), and the signature modular sofa components themselves feel approachable with `{rounded.lg}` (20px) on hero sections. The overall mood is one of quiet confidence — a brand that trusts its product to speak through clean lines, warm neutrals, and a palette that feels like a well-loved living room rather than a showroom.

## Components

### Buttons
**`button-primary`** — The primary call-to-action, used for "Add to Cart", "Shop Now", and checkout flows. Rendered on the warm terracotta (#e46950) with white text, it uses a soft 8px corner and 48px height for a substantial but approachable feel. On hover, it shifts to a deeper terracotta (#c95a43); when disabled, it fades to a lighter peach (#f0a08f) with reduced opacity.

**`button-secondary`** — A secondary action button used for "Learn More", "View Details", and "Configure". It sits on the warm canvas background with a subtle outline or filled state, maintaining the same 48px height and 8px radius for visual consistency. The text color is the deep charcoal ink (#383633), and on hover, the background darkens slightly to the surface-soft tone.

**`button-tertiary-text`** — A text-only button used for less prominent actions like "Cancel", "Skip", or "See all". It has no background or border, relying solely on the ink color and the button typography weight to communicate interactivity. On hover, it may underline or shift to the primary color.

### Cards
**`product-card`** — The primary content container for product listings, used on collection pages and search results. It features a white surface (#ffffff) with a soft 12px corner radius, a clean product image with rounded top corners, and structured typography for the product name, price, and star rating. The card casts a subtle shadow on hover to indicate interactivity.

**`hero-section`** — A full-width promotional banner used on the homepage and key landing pages. It uses the warm canvas background (#f7eee3) with large display typography and a prominent primary CTA. The section has a 20px corner radius at the bottom, creating a soft transition into the content below.

### Navigation
**`nav-bar`** — The persistent top navigation bar, 72px tall on desktop and 64px when scrolled. It uses the warm canvas background with the deep charcoal ink for text. The active nav link is indicated by a 2px solid terracotta underline, while inactive links use the muted gray (#767472). The bar includes a logo, category links, and a search icon.

**`nav-link-active`** — The active state for navigation items, distinguished by a terracotta underline and full-opacity ink color. This is used for the current page or section in the top nav.

**`nav-link-inactive`** — The default state for navigation items, using the muted gray color to visually recede while remaining legible. On hover, it transitions to the full ink color.

### Forms
**`text-input`** — Standard text input fields used in checkout, account forms, and newsletter signups. It has a warm canvas background, 48px height, 8px corner radius, and 16px horizontal padding. On focus, it gains a 2px terracotta border; on error, it shows a red border with an error message below.

**`search-bar`** — A pill-shaped search input with a full 9999px radius, used in the navigation and on search pages. It has a white surface background, a search icon in the muted gray, and placeholder text in the same muted tone. On focus, it expands slightly and gains a terracotta border.

### Badges
**`badge-new`** — A small, uppercase badge used to indicate new products or collections. It uses the terracotta background with white text, 4px corner radius, and tight padding. The typography is 11px with 0.5px letter spacing for a refined, editorial feel.

**`badge-sale`** — A badge for sale or promotional items, using a deeper wood-brown (#864c37) to differentiate from the new-product badge while maintaining the same structural format.

**`badge-outline`** — An outlined badge used for secondary labels like "Best Seller" or "Limited Edition". It has no background, using the ink color for text and a thin border in the hairline color.

### Footer
**`footer`** — The site footer, rendered on a dark surface (#202020) with white text for maximum contrast. It contains columns of links, a newsletter signup, and social media icons. Links use the muted-soft gray (#b6b4b4) to reduce visual weight, while headings use the full white for hierarchy.

### Accordion
**`accordion`** — A collapsible content component used for product details, FAQs, and configuration options. It has a warm canvas background with 8px corner radius, a clickable header with the title-sm typography, and expandable content area. The header includes a chevron icon that rotates on open.

### Swatches
**`color-swatch`** — A circular 32px color swatch used in product configuration for fabric and color options. It has a full rounded radius and a thin border in the hairline color. When selected, it gains a 2px terracotta ring and a checkmark icon.

### Quantity Selector
**`quantity-selector`** — A compact input for adjusting product quantities in the cart or on the product page. It has a warm canvas background, 40px height, 8px corner radius, and contains a minus button, the current quantity, and a plus button. The stepper buttons are circular with a 24px diameter.

## Responsive Behavior

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile | < 744px | Nav bar collapses to hamburger menu; product cards stack in single column; hero section reduces to 32px padding; search bar moves to drawer; footer columns stack vertically; accordions become full-width |
| Tablet | 744–1128px | Nav bar shows condensed links; product cards display in 2-column grid; hero section uses 48px padding; footer shows 2-column layout; search bar remains visible but compact |
| Desktop | 1128–1440px | Full nav bar with all links; product cards in 3-column grid; hero section uses 64px padding; footer shows 4-column layout; search bar is full width in nav |
| Wide | > 1440px | Max-width container at 1440px; product cards in 4-column grid; hero section uses 80px padding; all elements centered with generous whitespace |

### Touch Targets
- All interactive elements (buttons, links, inputs) maintain a minimum 44x44px touch target on mobile
- Nav bar hamburger icon is 48x48px for easy tapping
- Color swatches are 40x40px on mobile (up from 32px on desktop)
- Quantity selector stepper buttons are 32x32px on mobile
- Accordion headers have 48px minimum height for tap targets

### Collapsing Strategy
- Top nav collapses to hamburger menu below 744px, with a slide-in drawer for navigation links
- Product grid reduces from 4 columns (wide) to 3 (desktop) to 2 (tablet) to 1 (mobile)
- Footer columns collapse from 4 to 2 to 1 as viewport shrinks
- Hero section reduces padding and font sizes on mobile, with the CTA becoming full-width
- Search bar collapses to an icon on mobile, expanding to a full-width input on tap
- Product configuration options (swatches, quantity) stack vertically on mobile

## Known Gaps

- Hover and focus states for all components could not be fully extracted; only primary button hover was confirmed
- Error styling for text inputs (border color, error message typography) is inferred from common patterns
- Dark mode is not implemented on the live site; all tokens assume light mode
- Sub-brand or collection-specific palettes (e.g., outdoor, office) may exist but were not observed
- Animation and transition durations/easings were not extractable from static analysis
- Shadow values (box-shadow) for cards, modals, and dropdowns were not reliably captured
- Modal and overlay component styles (backdrop, close button, padding) were not observed
- Tooltip and popover styles are absent from the extracted data
- Loading states (spinners, skeletons) were not present in the analyzed pages
- The exact font weight for Suisse Intl in display sizes is assumed based on common usage; the brand may use custom weights
- Star rating component uses a gold tone (#e5be96) but exact sizing and spacing were not confirmed
- The "tool-free assembly" badge and its specific styling were not captured in detail
