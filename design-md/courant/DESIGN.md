description: A deep brown #50280f anchors a brand that sells wireless charging as an object of desire — not a utilitarian puck but a leather-and-metal heirloom meant to live on a nightstand or desk. The palette runs from that dark espresso through warm caramel #b15019 and a creamy off-white #f5efe7 that reads as unbleached linen rather than sterile paper. A restrained accent of crimson #d0011b appears only where urgency is needed — sale markers, error states — while the cooler slate #676986 and steel #979797 handle secondary text and borders. The typography relies on Priori Sans, a serif with enough personality to carry headlines without shouting, paired with a clean sans-serif for body copy. Buttons and cards use soft {rounded.sm} corners that suggest leather goods rather than glass screens; the overall effect is a store that feels more like a boutique hotel lobby than a tech accessory shop. The brand trusts material texture — leather grain, brushed metal, woven fabric — over gradients or heavy shadows, and the white space is generous enough that each product photograph breathes like a still life. There is no bright blue or neon accent; the brand's voltage comes from the contrast between warm brown and cream, with the occasional jolt of red.

## Components

### Buttons
**`button-primary`** — The primary call-to-action uses the signature espresso brown {colors.primary} on a white background, with uppercase Priori Sans at 14px and soft {rounded.sm} corners. On hover, the background deepens to {colors.primary-active} with no border or shadow change — the color shift is subtle, like leather darkening with age. The disabled state drops to a muted brown {colors.primary-disabled} that reads as faded suede.

**`button-secondary`** — An outlined variant with transparent fill and a 1px solid border in {colors.primary}. The text remains uppercase Priori Sans at 14px. On hover, the button fills solid with {colors.primary} and text flips to white — a deliberate inversion that signals commitment without urgency. Useful for "Learn More" or "View Details" actions alongside primary CTAs.

**`button-text`** — A borderless, backgroundless text button using {colors.primary} and uppercase Priori Sans. Reserved for secondary actions within cards or inline contexts where a full button would feel heavy. Hover adds no background, only a subtle opacity shift.

### Cards
**`product-card`** — A white card with {rounded.sm} corners containing a product image, title, and price. The image uses the same corner radius as the card, creating a seamless visual flow. The price is set in {typography.body-md} and colored {colors.primary} to draw the eye. Cards sit on the {colors.canvas} background with generous {spacing.lg} gutters. No shadow — the brand trusts the contrast between white card and warm cream canvas for separation.

**`product-card-image`** — The product photo fills the top of the card with {rounded.sm} corners. Images are high-contrast, well-lit product shots on neutral backgrounds — no lifestyle clutter. The aspect ratio is typically 1:1 for chargers and 3:4 for bundles.

### Navigation
**`nav-bar`** — A fixed top bar at 72px height on {colors.canvas} background. Navigation links use uppercase Priori Sans at 14px in {colors.ink}, with the active or hover state switching to {colors.primary}. The logo sits left-aligned, typically in {colors.primary} or {colors.ink}. The cart icon and account link sit right-aligned. On mobile, the nav collapses into a hamburger menu with a slide-out drawer.

**`nav-link-active`** — The active page or section link uses {colors.primary} text color with no underline or background change — the color shift alone signals state.

### Forms
**`text-input`** — A standard input field on {colors.canvas} background with a 1px {colors.hairline} border and {rounded.sm} corners. The placeholder text uses {colors.muted-soft}. On focus, the border switches to {colors.primary} — a warm brown glow rather than a blue ring. The height is 48px with 12px vertical padding for comfortable touch targets.

### Badges
**`badge-sale`** — A small pill-shaped badge in {colors.accent-red} with white uppercase text at 12px. Used sparingly — only for markdowns or limited-time offers. The red is the brand's only high-energy color, so its appearance carries weight.

**`badge-new`** — A warm caramel {colors.accent-warm} badge for new arrivals or restocks. Same shape and typography as the sale badge but in a tone that complements the primary palette rather than competing with it.

### Hero
**`hero-section`** — A full-width section on {colors.canvas} with a large headline in {typography.display-xl} and a single primary CTA. The hero image — typically a product shot on a neutral or textured background — sits beside or behind the text. No carousel, no multiple CTAs — the hero makes one clear offer.

**`hero-cta`** — The hero's primary button, identical to `button-primary` but with additional horizontal padding (32px) for visual weight at scale.

### Footer
**`footer`** — A deep brown {colors.primary} footer with white text. Links use {typography.link} in white with no underline. The footer contains brand navigation, customer service links, and social icons. The background color mirrors the brand's primary, creating a bookend effect with the top nav.

**`footer-link`** — White text links in the footer, using the sans-serif body font for readability at small sizes. No hover underline — the color contrast is sufficient.

### Dividers
**`divider`** — A 1px horizontal line in {colors.hairline} used to separate sections or card elements. In the footer, the divider uses a lighter tone to maintain contrast against the dark background.

## Responsive Behavior

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile | < 744px | Single-column product grid, hamburger nav, hero stacks vertically, buttons full-width, font sizes reduce by 2-4px |
| Tablet | 744–1128px | Two-column product grid, top nav collapses to icon-only, hero text and image side-by-side |
| Desktop | 1128–1440px | Three-column product grid, full top nav with links, hero at full width with generous margins |
| Wide | > 1440px | Max-width container at 1440px, centered content, hero scales with white space |

### Touch Targets
- All buttons and interactive elements minimum 44px height
- Product card tap targets include the entire card surface
- Nav links on mobile have 48px tap areas
- Cart and account icons minimum 44x44px

### Collapsing Strategy
- Top navigation links collapse into hamburger menu below 744px
- Product grid collapses from 3 columns to 2 at 1128px, to 1 at 744px
- Hero section stacks vertically on mobile (image above text)
- Footer links collapse into accordion-style sections on mobile
- Search bar collapses to icon-only on mobile, expands on tap

## Known Gaps

- Hover and active states for buttons and links are inferred from common patterns; exact transitions (duration, easing) not extracted
- Error states for form inputs (red border, error message styling) not observed
- Success/confirmation states (add-to-cart toast, checkout flow) not captured
- Dark mode or high-contrast mode not present on the live site
- Sub-brand or collection-specific color variations (e.g., limited editions) not documented
- Exact font weights for Priori Sans variants (regular, semibold, bold) not confirmed — weights above are best estimates
- Spacing values for specific components (e.g., card padding, section margins) are inferred from common e-commerce patterns
- The extracted hex list includes several grays and blues (#2c3e50, #0e7a82) that may be Shopify checkout defaults or stock image tones — the brand's true palette centers on #50280f, #f5efe7, and #b15019
- Animation durations and easing curves for hover states, page transitions, and loading states not extracted
- Icon set and social media icon colors not documented
