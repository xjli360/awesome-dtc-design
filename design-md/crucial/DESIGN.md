name: Crucial
description: A deep blue anchor of #0068ff that reads as engineered trust — not the friendly pastel of consumer tech but the saturated, confident blue of a company that makes the memory and storage your computer depends on. That primary blue runs through every primary CTA, every navigation highlight, and every product-badge accent, set against a near-white canvas of #fefefd that keeps the technical content airy and readable. The typography is all MicronBasis, a proprietary family that runs from the ultra-light (MicronBasis-Light at 300 weight) used for massive hero headlines to the black weight (MicronBasis-Black) reserved for pricing and critical calls to action — there is no generic system font here, every character carries the Micron parent brand's engineering authority. Product cards use a soft {rounded.md} radius, while buttons and badges take a tighter {rounded.sm}, and the search bar stretches across the top with a {rounded.full} pill shape that feels approachable despite the technical subject matter. The extracted palette reveals a surprising secondary voltage: #bd03f7 (a vivid magenta) and #3539f4 (a near-neon indigo) appear in spec-sheet highlights and compatibility-checker badges, giving the brand a subtle gaming/enthusiast undercurrent alongside the enterprise-blue surface. Gray values from #8c8c8c down to #f2f2f2 build a careful hierarchy for technical specifications, compatibility tables, and product comparisons — the brand trusts its data density and doesn't shy from showing you the full spec sheet. The overall mood is "premium component manufacturer who knows you care about the numbers": clean, blue-anchored, data-forward, with just enough accent color to signal that this storage can also be fast and fun.

## Components

### Buttons
**`button-primary`** — The primary call-to-action across the site, used for "Buy Now", "Add to Cart", and primary checkout flows. Rendered in the brand's signature #0068ff blue with white text and an 8px radius. On hover, shifts to #094db0 (primary-active). The disabled state uses #5ea0ff, a lighter blue that still reads as interactive but clearly inactive. Height is fixed at 48px with 12px vertical and 24px horizontal padding, using MicronBasis-Bold at 16px.

**`button-secondary`** — An outlined variant for secondary actions like "Compare" or "Learn More". Uses a white background with #0068ff text and a 1px solid border in the primary color. Active state fills the background with #f2f2f2 and shifts text to #094db0. Same 48px height and 8px radius as primary for visual consistency.

**`button-tertiary`** — A text-only link-style button for inline actions like "View Details" or "See All". No background, no border, just #0068ff text in MicronBasis-Bold. Used primarily in product listing contexts where multiple CTAs would clutter the layout.

**`button-large`** — A taller, wider variant of the primary button reserved for hero sections and landing-page CTAs. 56px height with 16px vertical and 32px horizontal padding, using the larger 18px button typography. Same #0068ff background and 8px radius.

### Navigation
**`nav-bar`** — The persistent top navigation bar at 72px height on a white (#fefefd) background. Contains the Crucial logo, primary nav links in MicronBasis-Medium at 15px, a search bar, and a cart icon. On scroll, gains a 1px bottom border in #e6e6e6 (hairline-soft). Nav links use #0a0a0a (ink) with a #0068ff underline on active/hover states.

**`nav-dropdown`** — Mega-menu style dropdowns for product categories (SSDs, DRAM, Storage). White background with 12px radius, 8px internal padding, and links in MicronBasis-Regular at 14px. Product sub-categories are grouped with light gray (#f2f2f2) dividers.

### Search
**`search-bar`** — A full-radius pill-shaped search input that sits prominently in the nav bar and also appears as a standalone component on the homepage. Uses a #f2f2f2 background that shifts to white on focus, with a 1px #0068ff border appearing on focus. The pill shape (9999px radius) and 48px height make it feel approachable despite the technical brand context.

### Product Cards
**`product-card`** — The primary content container for product listings, used on category pages and search results. White background with 12px radius and 16px internal padding. On hover, gains a subtle box shadow (0 4px 12px rgba(10,10,10,0.08)). Contains a product image (8px radius), title, capacity/speed specs, price in MicronBasis-Black at 28px, and compatibility badges.

### Badges
**`badge-sale`** — A red (#ec0b00) badge with white uppercase text in MicronBasis-Bold at 11px. Used for promotional pricing and clearance items. 4px radius with 2px vertical and 8px horizontal padding.

**`badge-new`** — A green (#01ab01) badge for newly released products. Same typography and sizing as the sale badge, but in green to signal freshness rather than discount.

**`badge-compatible`** — A blue-on-blue badge (#e2f4ff background, #0063f8 text) used on the compatibility checker results to indicate which products work with a user's system. More subdued than the primary brand blue, designed to sit alongside product cards without competing.

### Spec Tables
**`spec-table-row`** — Rows in technical specification tables, separated by a 1px #e6e6e6 bottom border with 12px vertical padding. Labels use MicronBasis-Regular at 13px in #4f5a6c (a muted blue-gray), while values use MicronBasis-Medium at 14px in #0a0a0a. This contrast creates a clear hierarchy for data-dense product pages.

### Hero Section
**`hero-section`** — Full-width hero banners on the homepage and campaign pages. White background with 64px vertical padding. Headlines use MicronBasis-Light at 48px for a clean, authoritative statement. Primary CTAs sit below in the button-large format. Hero imagery typically shows product photography against gradient backgrounds that pull from the brand blue (#0068ff) to the accent magenta (#bd03f7).

### Compatibility Checker
**`compatibility-checker`** — A distinctive interactive component that lets users find compatible memory/storage for their system. Uses a #f2f2f2 background with 12px radius and 24px padding. Contains a dropdown for system/manufacturer selection, a search field, and a "Find Compatible" button. Results appear as a list of product cards with compatibility badges.

### Footer
**`footer`** — A dark footer on #0a0a0a (ink) background with text in #bfbfbf (muted-soft). Organized in columns for product categories, support, company info, and legal links. Uses MicronBasis-Regular at 14px for body text and MicronBasis-Medium for column headers. Includes social media icons, a newsletter signup, and copyright information. Vertical padding of 64px with 32px horizontal padding.

## Responsive Behavior

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile | < 744px | Nav collapses to hamburger menu; product cards go single-column; spec tables stack label/value vertically; hero headlines reduce to 32px; search bar becomes full-width below nav |
| Tablet | 744–1128px | Nav links truncate to key items (Products, Support, About); product cards in 2-column grid; spec tables remain horizontal but with reduced font sizes; hero headlines at 40px |
| Desktop | 1128–1440px | Full nav with dropdowns; product cards in 3- or 4-column grid; standard spec table layout; hero at full 48px headline |
| Wide | > 1440px | Max-width container at 1440px with centered content; additional whitespace on sides; product cards can expand to 4-column with larger images |

### Touch Targets
- All interactive elements (buttons, links, inputs) maintain minimum 44x44px touch target
- Nav bar hamburger icon at 48x48px on mobile
- Product card CTAs at 48px height for easy tapping
- Search bar at 48px height with generous internal padding
- Dropdown menus have 44px minimum item height

### Collapsing Strategy
- Top nav collapses to hamburger menu below 744px, with full nav in a slide-out drawer
- Product filters collapse to a "Filter" button that opens a modal/overlay on mobile
- Spec tables with more than 4 rows collapse to "Show all specs" expandable sections
- Footer columns stack vertically on mobile, with accordion-style expandable sections
- Compatibility checker results collapse to a single-column list on mobile

## Known Gaps

- Hover and focus states for many components (especially text inputs, dropdowns, and product cards) were inferred from common patterns rather than extracted from the live site
- Error styling for form validation (red borders, error messages) is based on the extracted #ec0b00 accent red but exact implementation details are unknown
- Dark mode is not present on the live site and no dark-mode tokens are defined
- The exact font-weight values for MicronBasis variants (Light, Regular, Medium, Bold, Black) were estimated based on standard weight naming conventions — the actual CSS may use different numeric values
- Sub-brand palettes for Crucial's gaming line (if any) or enterprise products were not extractable from the main site
- Animation and transition timing values (durations, easing curves) were not captured
- The compatibility checker's interactive states (loading, empty results, error results) need direct observation
- Pricing display formats (strikethrough for sales, currency symbols) need verification
- The extracted color list includes many generic web colors (#444444, #ffff00, #66ff00, etc.) that likely come from third-party widgets or stock imagery — the true brand palette is anchored on #0068ff with secondary accents in #bd03f7, #3539f4, and #01ab01
