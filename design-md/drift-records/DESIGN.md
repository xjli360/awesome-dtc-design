description: A record shop that feels like a well-kept listening room, where the brand voltage comes from a single gilded note: #ab8c52, a muted brass that appears in the browser chrome, hover states, and the occasional accent line — never loud, always intentional. The canvas is #f5f2ec, a warm off-white that reads as aged paper rather than sterile digital white, and the ink is #212121, a near-black that keeps body text grounded. Type runs a curious two-face system: PPMonumentExtended-Regular for display headlines — a condensed, architectural sans that gives track listings and section titles a printed-matter gravity — and YoungSerif-Regular for body copy, a serif with a gentle hand-drawn quality that softens the grid. The palette is restrained but not minimal: #e8d4ae and #806430 extend the brass family into highlights and secondary surfaces, while #fadada appears as a blush accent on sale badges or limited-edition markers, a small warmth against the otherwise earthy, ochre-leaning scheme. Buttons are pill-shaped, cards have soft corners, and the overall feel is that of a shop that values the object — the vinyl sleeve, the liner notes, the paper stock — over the algorithm. The nav is a single horizontal strip, the search bar is a rounded input with a brass-toned icon, and every product card sits on a #fcfbf9 surface with a #d9d9d9 hairline, as if each record is displayed on its own light box.

## Components

### Buttons
**`button-primary`** — The primary call-to-action across the site, used for "Add to Cart", "Checkout", and primary form submissions. Rendered as a pill-shaped button with a brass fill and white text. On hover, the fill deepens to `{colors.primary-active}` (#9a7e4a). In its disabled state, the background fades to `{colors.primary-disabled}` (#e8d4ae) and the cursor becomes not-allowed.
**`button-secondary`** — An outlined variant for secondary actions like "View Details" or "Save for Later". Uses the canvas background with a single hairline border and ink text. On hover, the background shifts to `{colors.surface-soft}` (#f7f4ef). The border remains visible in both states.
**`button-tertiary-text`** — A text-only button for inline actions like "Clear filters" or "Cancel". Uses the primary brass color for the text, no background, and no border. The text underlines on hover.
**`button-pill-gold`** — A smaller, brighter pill used for promotional badges or limited-time offers. Uses `{colors.accent-gold}` (#fab84f) as the background with ink text. This is the only button that breaks the brass family — it signals urgency or specialness.

### Navigation
**`nav-bar`** — A fixed top bar at 64px height, using the warm canvas background and a soft hairline bottom border. Navigation links are set in uppercase Helvetica with 0.5px letter spacing. The active link is underlined with a 2px brass line. The bar contains the shop logo, main nav links (New Arrivals, Genres, Sales, About), a search icon, and a cart icon with a brass badge.
**`nav-link-active`** — The currently selected navigation item. The text color shifts to brass and a 2px brass underline appears. The rest of the link styling remains uppercase Helvetica.
**`nav-link-inactive`** — Default navigation links in muted gray. On hover, the text color shifts to the ink value.

### Cards
**`product-card`** — The primary record display component. A white card on a warm canvas background with a soft hairline border and 8px rounded corners. Each card contains a square-format product image (280px height, top corners rounded) and a text block below with the artist name (muted, caption), album title (title-sm, ink), and price (body-sm, body). On hover, the border turns brass and a subtle shadow lifts the card.
**`product-card-hover`** — The hover state adds a brass border and a 4px/12px shadow. The cursor changes to pointer. No other visual change — the brand trusts the border color shift as sufficient feedback.

### Forms
**`text-input`** — Standard text input for search, newsletter signup, and checkout forms. Uses the warm canvas background, a hairline border, and 8px rounded corners. On focus, the border shifts to brass. In error state, the border turns red (#d20000) and the text color matches.
**`search-bar`** — A pill-shaped search input with a soft surface background and a lighter hairline border. The search icon sits to the left in brass. On focus, the border turns brass and the background may lighten slightly. The placeholder text is in muted-soft.

### Badges
**`badge-new`** — A small gold badge used on new arrival records. Uses `{colors.badge-new}` (#fab240) as the background with ink text, set in uppercase Helvetica at 11px with 0.5px letter spacing.
**`badge-sale`** — A blush-toned badge for sale items. Uses `{colors.badge-sale}` (#fadada) as the background with ink text. Same typography as the new badge.
**`badge-out-of-stock`** — A neutral badge for unavailable items. Uses a strong surface background with muted text. The same uppercase typography applies.

### Footer
**`footer`** — A dark footer section using the ink color as background and warm canvas for text. Links are set in muted-soft and turn brass on hover. The footer contains the shop name, a short about paragraph, navigation links, social media icons, and a newsletter signup form. Padding is generous at 48px top and bottom.

### Hero
**`hero-section`** — The top-of-page hero area for landing pages and collection launches. Uses the warm canvas background with generous 64px vertical padding. The title is set in display-xl (PPMonumentExtended-Regular, 32px) and the subtitle in body-md (YoungSerif-Regular, 16px) with a max width of 600px for readability. No background image — the brand lets the typography and whitespace carry the weight.

### Filters
**`filter-chip`** — A pill-shaped filter option used in genre or category strips. Uses a soft surface background with a hairline border and caption typography. The active state fills the chip with brass and white text. Multiple chips can be active simultaneously.

## Responsive Behavior

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile | < 744px | Nav collapses to hamburger menu. Product cards go to single column (1-up). Hero padding reduces to 32px. Search bar moves below nav. Filter chips wrap to two rows. Footer stacks vertically. |
| Tablet | 744–1128px | Nav shows all links but reduces font size to 12px. Product cards display in 2-up grid. Hero padding at 48px. Search bar remains in nav. Filter chips show in a horizontal scrollable strip. |
| Desktop | 1128–1440px | Full nav with 14px links. Product cards in 3-up grid. Hero at full 64px padding. Search bar centered in nav. Filter chips in a single row with overflow. |
| Wide | > 1440px | Max content width of 1440px, centered. Product cards in 4-up grid. Additional whitespace on sides. Hero content max-width at 800px. |

### Touch Targets
- All buttons and links: minimum 44px height, 44px width where applicable.
- Filter chips: minimum 32px height, 44px width for tap targets.
- Cart icon and search icon: minimum 44px tap area (icon is 24px with 10px padding).
- Nav links: minimum 44px tap area on mobile.
- Product cards: entire card is tappable, minimum 280px height.

### Collapsing Strategy
- On mobile (< 744px), the top nav collapses to a hamburger menu. The drawer slides in from the left, showing all nav links in a stacked layout with 48px tap targets.
- The search bar moves from the nav to a dedicated row below the nav on mobile.
- Filter chips collapse from a single row to a two-row wrap on mobile, with a "Show all filters" button that opens a modal.
- The footer collapses from a multi-column layout to a single column on mobile.
- Product cards collapse from multi-column grids to single column on mobile.

## Known Gaps

- Hover states for product card images (zoom, overlay, or color shift) could not be extracted from the static CSS.
- Error styling for form validation beyond the text-input error state (e.g., inline error messages, success states) was not found.
- The exact font weights for PPMonumentExtended-Regular and YoungSerif-Regular are assumed to be 400 (Regular) as no weight variants were declared. The brand may use additional weights (e.g., Bold, Light) that were not present in the extracted CSS.
- Dropdown menu styling (e.g., genre selectors, sort-by options) was not captured.
- Modal/dialog styling for cart preview, quick view, or mobile nav was not found.
- Dark mode or high-contrast mode styles were not present in the extracted data.
- The extracted color list is large (30+ colors) and includes likely checkout-widget colors (e.g., #f39f83, #8191a4) and social-icon colors. The primary palette above focuses on the most distinctive and frequent brand colors (#ab8c52, #f5f2ec, #212121, #e8d4ae, #806430). The remaining colors may be used for third-party integrations or one-off components.
- Animation and transition durations (e.g., button hover, card lift) were not specified in the extracted CSS.
- The exact Shopify platform integration (cart drawer, checkout button, product variant selector) styling was not fully captured.
