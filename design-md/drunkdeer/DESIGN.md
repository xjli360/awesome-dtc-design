description: A high-performance gaming keyboard brand that operates in the dark — literally. The canvas is #121212, not white; the primary voltage is #874cd3, a saturated violet that reads as cybernetic signal rather than playful accent. This is a brand that trusts deep shadow (#222222, #282828) and near-black (#111111) as its comfortable habitat, letting the purple pulse as the only color that escapes the void. Typography runs Montserrat and Poppins at modest weights — display sits at 24–32px in weight 500/600, never screaming, because the keyboards themselves are the visual spectacle. The extracted border-radius of 10px (`{rounded.md}`) appears consistently across product cards, buttons, and module edges — a single, repeatable corner radius that gives the interface a precise, machined feel without going fully pill-shaped. The meta theme-color of #282828 confirms the brand lives in this dark space even in the browser chrome. Product imagery is the hero: keyboards photographed in low light with per-key RGB glow, making each switch and keycap a point of light against the black. The violet (#874cd3) appears in primary CTAs, active states, and accent highlights — it is the single brand voltage that carries every "Add to Cart" button and spec-badge dot. There is no white anywhere except on text (#dedede body copy) and on-primary surfaces. The brand feels like a control room at night: focused, illuminated only where necessary, and built for precision.

## Components

### Buttons
**`button-primary`** — The primary call-to-action across the site, rendered in the brand's distinctive violet (#874cd3). Hover state shifts to `{colors.primary-active}` (#6b3aa8) for a subtle darkening effect, while disabled state drops to `{colors.primary-disabled}` (#3d2a5c) with muted text. The 10px corner radius (`{rounded.md}`) matches the machined aesthetic of the keyboards themselves.

**`button-secondary`** — A dark card-background button with a hairline border, used for less prominent actions like "View Details" or "Compare". The border provides definition against the dark canvas without competing with the primary violet.

**`button-tertiary-text`** — A text-only button using the primary violet, reserved for inline actions like "Learn More" or "Read Specs". No background or border keeps it minimal against the dark interface.

**`button-pill-accent`** — A fully pill-shaped variant used for small badges, filter tags, and quick-action toggles. The full roundness (`{rounded.full}`) creates a deliberate contrast with the otherwise consistent 10px radius system.

### Navigation
**`top-nav`** — A fixed 72px dark bar with uppercase nav links in Montserrat 500. Active links glow in the brand violet, while inactive links sit in muted gray. A single-pixel hairline border at the bottom provides the only separation from content.

**`nav-link-active` / `nav-link-inactive`** — Uppercase navigation links that shift color to signal current section. The uppercase treatment and 0.5px letter-spacing give the nav a technical, precision-oriented feel.

### Cards
**`product-card`** — The primary product display unit, built on `{colors.surface-card}` (#222222) with 10px rounded corners. Each card contains a product image (also 10px rounded), a title, specs, and price. The dark card against the #121212 canvas creates subtle depth without harsh shadows.

**`product-card-badge`** — A small violet badge pinned to product cards for "New", "Sale", or "Pre-order" indicators. The 4px radius (`{rounded.xs}`) keeps it compact and legible.

**`spec-badge`** — A neutral badge used for technical specifications (switch type, connectivity, layout). The soft background and muted text keep specs readable without competing with primary badges.

### Forms
**`text-input`** — Dark card-background input fields with hairline borders and 10px radius. Focus state swaps the border to primary violet, creating a clear active indicator against the dark interface.

**`search-bar`** — A dedicated search input matching the text-input pattern but with reduced height for header placement. The 10px radius maintains consistency with the button system.

**`quantity-selector`** — A compact control for cart quantity adjustments, built on a soft surface with button-sm typography. The 36px height keeps it proportional alongside product cards.

## Responsive Behavior

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile | < 744px | Single-column product grid; nav collapses to hamburger; hero text reduces to `{typography.display-md}`; buttons go full-width |
| Tablet | 744–1128px | Two-column product grid; nav links remain visible but condensed; hero maintains `{typography.display-lg}` |
| Desktop | 1128–1440px | Three-column product grid; full nav with all links; hero at `{typography.display-xl}` |
| Wide | > 1440px | Four-column product grid; max-width container at 1440px; hero content centered |

### Touch Targets
- All interactive elements maintain minimum 44px height for touch accessibility
- Icon buttons and quantity selectors at 40px and 36px respectively — acceptable for desktop but should expand to 44px on mobile
- Product card tap targets (entire card is clickable) at minimum 200px height

### Collapsing Strategy
- Top nav collapses to hamburger menu below 744px, with slide-out drawer from the left
- Product grid collapses from 4 columns → 3 → 2 → 1 as viewport shrinks
- Hero section reduces typography scale and stacks CTA buttons vertically below 744px
- Footer links collapse into accordion-style sections below 744px
- Search bar collapses to icon-only trigger below 744px, expanding to full-width overlay on tap

## Known Gaps

- Hover and focus states for most components could not be reliably extracted from the live site; only primary button hover was inferred from the active color
- Error styling for form inputs (validation messages, error borders) was not present in extracted data
- Dark mode is the default and only mode — no light mode variant was detected
- Sub-brand or collection-specific color palettes (e.g., limited edition keyboard colors) were not captured
- The extracted hex list includes several near-black values (#111111, #222222, #282828, #121212) that appear to be different surfaces rather than a single canvas — the exact hierarchy of dark surfaces is inferred from typical gaming keyboard site patterns
- Font weight hierarchy (which weights map to which text roles) is partially inferred from common Montserrat/Poppins usage patterns
- Animation and transition timing values were not extractable from static CSS
- The extracted colors include #112211, #111177, and #111166 which may be RGB LED accent colors or checkout-widget artifacts — their exact usage context is unclear
