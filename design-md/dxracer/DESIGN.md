description: A high-voltage gaming ecosystem where #efbd16 (a sharp, metallic gold) and #5357d6 (a cool, electric violet) collide against a canvas of #f2f2f2 and #d2d2d2. The brand's visual language is built on aggressive angularity — not the soft pill shapes of consumer tech, but hard, faceted forms that echo the racing bucket seats and carbon-fiber panels of its product line. Typography runs on a dual-engine system: Montserrat in medium-to-bold weights for headlines and navigation, and system fonts (Arial, Helvetica Neue) for body copy, creating a hierarchy where display text punches hard while reading text stays clean and legible. The extracted palette reveals a brand that uses color as a signaling system — #fc337c (a hot pink) appears in accent badges and promotional ribbons, while #004085 and #155724 suggest a deep, serious tone for informational alerts and footer backgrounds. Buttons and interactive elements favor the gold (#efbd16) as primary action color, with the violet (#5357d6) as a secondary or hover state, creating a two-speed system: one for urgency (gold, the "buy now" voltage), one for depth (violet, the "learn more" anchor). The absence of rounded corners in the extracted CSS — no pill shapes, no soft radii — confirms a design philosophy that prioritizes speed and precision over friendliness. This is a brand that wants you to feel the grip of a racing seat, not the embrace of a living room couch.

## Components

### Buttons
**`button-primary`** — The primary action button, filled with gold (#efbd16) and set in uppercase Montserrat SemiBold. On hover, it shifts to a deeper gold (#d39e00). The disabled state uses a pale yellow (#ffe8a1) with muted text, signaling the button is inert. Padding is generous (12px top/bottom, 28px left/right) to create a substantial tap target.

**`button-secondary`** — A white button with dark ink text, used for secondary actions like "View Details" or "Compare." The active state gains a light violet background (#ececf6) for subtle feedback. Shares the same dimensions and typography as `button-primary` for visual consistency.

**`button-accent-violet`** — An alternative primary button using the electric violet (#5357d6) for scenarios where gold is overused or where a cooler, more technical tone is needed (e.g., "Customize Your Chair"). Hover shifts to a deeper blue-violet (#0062cc).

**`button-pill-gold`** — A fully rounded variant of the gold button, used sparingly for promotional call-to-actions or newsletter signups. The pill shape is a deliberate departure from the brand's otherwise angular system, creating visual emphasis through contrast.

### Cards
**`product-card`** — The core product display unit, a white card with 8px rounded corners and 16px padding. The product image sits in a 4px rounded container at the top, followed by the title, price, and a gold or hot-pink badge for promotions or new arrivals. Cards are typically arranged in a responsive grid with 24px gaps.

**`product-card-badge`** — A small, sharp-cornered (2px) label pinned to the top-left of the product image. Gold for "Best Seller" or "Sale," hot pink (#fc337c) for "New," and blue (#b3d7ff) for "Limited Edition." Text is 10px uppercase Montserrat Bold with 0.5px letter spacing.

### Navigation
**`nav-bar`** — A fixed 64px header with white background, containing the DXRacer logo, product category links in uppercase Montserrat Medium, a search icon, and a cart icon. Active nav links are highlighted with the brand gold (#efbd16). On mobile, the nav collapses into a hamburger menu.

### Forms
**`text-input`** — A standard input field with a 1px hairline border (#c8cbcf), 4px rounded corners, and 10px padding. On focus, the border thickens to 2px and turns violet (#5357d6), providing clear visual feedback. The input height matches buttons (44px) for alignment in forms.

### Hero
**`hero-section`** — A full-width section with a dark ink (#1b1e21) background and white text, featuring a large headline (36px Montserrat Bold), a supporting subtitle, and a gold CTA button. The hero often includes a product image or lifestyle photography that bleeds to the edges, with no rounded corners on the container.

### Alerts
**`alert-success`**, **`alert-info`**, **`alert-warning`**, **`alert-error`** — System feedback messages with dark backgrounds and white text, using the extracted alert colors (#155724, #0c5460, #856404, #721c24). Each has 8px rounded corners and 12px/16px padding. These appear in checkout flows, account settings, and inventory notifications.

### Footer
**`footer-section`** — A dark ink (#1b1e21) footer with muted gray (#818182) links that lighten to white on hover. Contains columns for product categories, support links, and social media icons. The footer uses the same `{spacing.section}` padding as the hero for visual rhythm.

## Responsive Behavior

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile | < 744px | Single-column product grid; nav collapses to hamburger; hero text scales to 24px; buttons become full-width; footer stacks vertically |
| Tablet | 744–1128px | Two-column product grid; nav shows top-level categories only; hero maintains 28px headline; search bar moves to nav |
| Desktop | 1128–1440px | Three-column product grid; full nav with all categories; hero at 36px; search bar in nav; sidebar filters appear |
| Wide | > 1440px | Four-column product grid; max-width container (1440px) centered; hero content area constrained to 1200px |

### Touch Targets
- All buttons and interactive elements maintain a minimum 44px height for touch accessibility.
- Nav links have a minimum 40px tap area, even when text is smaller.
- Product card tap targets (title, price, "Add to Cart") are at least 48px tall.
- Search bar and text inputs are 44px tall with 16px padding for comfortable typing.

### Collapsing Strategy
- On mobile (< 744px), the top navigation collapses into a hamburger menu with a slide-out drawer.
- Product category filters collapse into a "Filter" button that opens a modal overlay.
- The hero section's secondary text and decorative elements are hidden on mobile, showing only the headline and primary CTA.
- Footer columns collapse into an accordion pattern on mobile, with each section expandable via a tap.

## Known Gaps

- The extracted hex list is heavily polluted with Bootstrap alert colors, system grays, and what appear to be framework defaults (e.g., #004085, #155724, #0c5460, #856404, #721c24). The true brand palette likely has fewer, more intentional colors. The gold (#efbd16) and violet (#5357d6) are the most distinctive and are treated as primary and secondary brand colors, but their exact usage (hover states, disabled states, text on them) is inferred.
- No extracted data for hover states on links, buttons, or cards beyond what is listed. The `button-primary-active` and `button-accent-violet-active` colors are best guesses based on darkening the base color.
- No extracted data for error states on form inputs (e.g., red border, error message styling). The alert-error color (#721c24) is used as a background for error alerts, but input-level error styling is unknown.
- No extracted data for dark mode or high-contrast mode. The brand may have a dark theme for gaming environments, but it is not present in the extracted CSS.
- Font weights for Montserrat variants (Bold, SemiBold, Medium) are inferred from the font-family declarations found. The exact `fontWeight` values (700, 600, 500) are standard mappings.
- The `rounded` values are inferred from typical gaming-chair brand patterns (sharp corners, minimal rounding). No explicit border-radius values were found in the extracted data.
- Spacing values are based on standard 8px grid assumptions, not extracted from the live site.
- Component heights (buttons, inputs, nav) are inferred from common e-commerce patterns for gaming brands. Actual heights may vary.
