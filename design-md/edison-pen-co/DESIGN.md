  Parchment arrives before chrome at Edison Pen Co. The dominant surface is #dcd7ca — an unbleached cream much closer to cotton rag paper than digital white — and it primes every visitor to decelerate before reading a single word: this is a maker's site, not a marketplace. Against that warm field, crimson (#cd2653) appears with the economy of a wax seal: at the single decisive CTA moment — add to cart, confirm selection, initiate custom order — and nowhere else. The rest of the palette reads like a working desk: charcoal (#32373c) for running copy, near-black (#1e1f26) for display headings, and a deep molasses brown (#382110) that suggests dried iron-gall ink pooled in a glass bottle under an incandescent lamp. Muted gray (#6d6d6d) and its lighter sibling (#949494) handle secondary copy and ornamental hairlines without competing with the warm ground.

  Typography is unapologetically pre-digital. Palatino and Georgia dominate the display hierarchy — serif stacks chosen for a customer who selected a fountain pen over a ballpoint, who registered that a nib was adjusted by hand. System sans-serif (Geneva, Verdana) enters only for form labels, utility navigation, and small swatches; brief, functional appearances that prevent the reading experience from sliding into commodity UI. Display scale sits at 28–40px at normal weight (400) rather than the bold-heavy register of apparel brands; type trusts white space rather than mass to assert hierarchy.

  Corners are almost uniformly square. Product cards, swatches, and image frames carry {rounded.xs} at most — coherent with the hand-turned acrylic and ebonite rods Edison machines on a lathe. Pill shapes ({rounded.full}) appear exclusively on finish-color swatch circles. Spacing breathes generously in editorial zones — section gaps at 64px or wider let photography carry the argument — then contracts to a consistent grid on catalog pages where comparison is the primary job. The footer holds the same parchment canvas as the header and lets secondary navigation recede to muted gray (#949494), keeping the warm groundplane unbroken from masthead to page end.

## Components

### Buttons

**`button-primary`** — Square-cornered ({rounded.none}), crimson (#cd2653) fill, uppercase Geneva 13px at 0.8px letter-spacing, 44px tall. The all-caps treatment reads as a printer's slug — functional and print-adjacent rather than a soft digital affordance. On hover darkens to #a81e43; disabled state fades fill to the blush #e8a0b2 while retaining white text and a `not-allowed` cursor. Used exclusively for the single decisive action per page: add to cart, submit custom inquiry, confirm selection.

**`button-secondary`** — Transparent fill, 1px solid charcoal (#32373c) border, same uppercase Geneva label and 44px height as primary. On hover, fill inverts to charcoal and text lifts to canvas (#dcd7ca), performing a linocut-print reversal. Used for secondary CTAs: view details, browse collection, learn about nibs.

**`button-ghost`** — No border, no fill, muted gray (#6d6d6d) uppercase text in 11px Geneva. Underline appears on hover. Used for tertiary actions and dismiss affordances that should not compete visually with either primary or secondary buttons.

### Navigation

**`nav-bar`** — 64px tall, parchment canvas (#dcd7ca) background with a 1px hairline border at the bottom. All links in Geneva 13px at 0.2px tracking. Active link shifts to crimson (#cd2653) with a matching 1px underline. No heavy drop-shadow menus — subcategories open as flat panels matching the canvas color. Logo anchors left; cart and search icons anchor right as minimal icon buttons.

**`announcement-bar`** — A full-width molasses strip (#382110) placed above the nav, 36px tall, centered Geneva 12px in canvas-colored (#dcd7ca) text. Reserved for lead-time notices ("Custom orders currently shipping in 8–10 weeks"), promotional events, and supply alerts. The dark warm brown grounds the page before the parchment navigation appears.

### Product Card

**`product-card`** — Zero radius, no box-shadow, no card border. Pen photography sits at a 4:3 ratio against a soft gray (#f0f0f0) panel. Pen name in Georgia 18px below the image, followed by price in Georgia 20px charcoal. Finish-color swatches (20px circles with {rounded.full}) sit in a horizontal row below the price; the selected swatch receives a 2px outline-offset ring in body charcoal, emulating the contact ring left by a barrel held flat. Hover state on the card image offers a subtle 1:1.03 scale — no shadow theater.

### Hero

**`hero`** — Parchment canvas (#dcd7ca) ground, minimum 560px tall with equal 64px vertical padding. Headline in Palatino 40px at normal weight — wide enough to command attention without resorting to typographic heaviness. Sub-headline in Georgia 16px, muted gray (#6d6d6d), capped at 520px for comfortable line length. A single `button-primary` anchors below with 24px gap. No carousel; one full-width pen photograph preferred, lit from a single source to emphasize material grain and finish depth.

### Collection Filter

**`collection-filter`** — Text-only tab row with no pill outlines or card backgrounds. Inactive filters in muted gray (#6d6d6d), Geneva 13px; the active filter shifts to ink (#1e1f26) and gains a 1px bottom border — like a proofreader's underline mark. Filters cover pen series, material category, price tier, and nib size. On mobile the row becomes horizontally scrollable without wrapping.

### Model Selector

**`model-selector`** — Flat rectangular option tile with 1px hairline border ({rounded.none}). On selection, border sharpens to body charcoal (#32373c) and background lifts to canvas parchment (#dcd7ca). Used on the product detail page for pen body material (acrylic, ebonite, urushi), nib grade (student, artist, flex), and color variant. Selected state is legible at a glance without requiring radio-button chrome.

### Nib Spec Table

**`nib-spec-table`** — Soft gray (#f0f0f0) background panel, Georgia 14px for cell content, rows divided by 1px hairlines (#dddddd). Surfaces nib width (EF through BBB), feed material, slit geometry, and recommended ink viscosity in structured rows. The serif body type in a spec table is intentional: it signals that this data deserves to be read like a reference, not scanned like a feature matrix.

### Pen Image Viewer

**`pen-image-viewer`** — Main image at 4:3 aspect ratio, soft gray background, 1px soft hairline border. A horizontal strip of thumbnail tiles (72×54px each) sits below; the active thumbnail carries a 1px body-charcoal border. No lightbox modal by default — the large image expands in-place rather than interrupting the page reading flow.

### Custom Pen CTA Band

**`custom-pen-cta`** — Full-width editorial band in molasses brown (#382110), Palatino 24px headline in canvas text, body paragraph in muted gray (#949494). 64px top and bottom padding. Sits between the catalog section and the footer. Square-cornered, no decorative border. This is the brand's single moment of chromatic departure from the warm neutral field — it functions as a register shift, signaling that custom work is a different relationship than catalog purchase.

### Footer

**`footer`** — Continuous parchment canvas from the page body, divided only by a 1px hairline at the top. Section headings in Georgia 16px charcoal; links in Geneva 12px muted gray (#949494), spaced with 8px vertical gaps. No contrasting dark footer background — the page ends as it begins, on the same warm cream ground that opened it.

## Responsive Behavior

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile | < 744px | Single-column product grid; nav collapses to hamburger drawer on parchment background; hero headline drops to Palatino 28px; finish swatches wrap to two rows; announcement bar truncates to one key message; nib spec table scrolls horizontally |
| Tablet | 744–1128px | Two-column product grid; nav shows primary categories inline, secondary links in overflow drawer; hero shifts to 50/50 image–text split with image right; custom pen CTA reduces to 40px vertical padding |
| Desktop | 1128–1440px | Three- or four-column catalog grid; full horizontal nav with all primary categories visible; hero at full 560px with centered composition; nib spec table displayed in full |
| Wide | > 1440px | Content max-width 1280px centered on the parchment canvas; catalog grid holds at four columns; hero photography expands edge-to-edge behind a constrained text container |

### Touch Targets
- All interactive elements — buttons, finish swatches, filter tabs, nav links, thumbnail tiles — maintain a minimum 44×44px touch area
- Finish swatch circles (20px visual diameter) receive a 44px invisible tap target via padding or pseudo-element expansion
- Model selector tiles padded to 44px height on mobile regardless of label length
- Thumbnail strip tiles expand to full-bleed tap regions on mobile

### Collapsing Strategy
- Navigation: full horizontal links on desktop → hamburger slide-in drawer on mobile with parchment background (#dcd7ca) and standard nav-link typography
- Collection filter: horizontal tab row on desktop → single-line horizontally-scrollable row on mobile (no wrapping, no dropdown collapse)
- Custom pen CTA band: vertical padding reduces from 64px to 32px on mobile; headline steps down from display-md (24px) to display-sm (20px) Palatino
- Nib spec table: horizontal scroll on mobile rather than column collapse — data integrity takes priority over layout compression
- Hero: stacks image above text on mobile; image shifts to 100vw bleed and text sits below in full-width block with standard horizontal padding

## Known Gaps

- Many extracted hex values (#21759b, #00d084, #0693e3, #fdf497, #ff9900, #5865f2, #e94c89, #02e49b, #0757fe, #0a7aff, #4280ff, #f45800, #0866ff, #0461dd, #1d4fc4, #f00075, #e65678) appear to originate from WordPress Gutenberg editor UI, social-share widgets, or embedded third-party services — they were excluded from the brand palette
- No meta theme-color was found; mobile browser chrome color is unspecified and will default to system behavior
- Font stacks are system defaults (Geneva, Verdana, Georgia, Palatino) with no evidence of custom web fonts loaded via @font-face or Google Fonts; if a proprietary typeface exists, it was not detectable from extracted metadata
- No explicit dark-mode palette was detected; canvas/parchment inversion behavior for prefers-color-scheme: dark is unspecified
- Logo treatment, wordmark dimensions, and any logomark SVG data were not extractable from meta or CSS
- Exact transition durations and easing curves not extracted — 150ms ease assumed throughout
- No animation or micro-interaction tokens (parallax, scroll-triggered reveals) detected from available data
- Product photography art direction (background color, lighting angle, prop styling) inferred from brand category; not directly extractable
