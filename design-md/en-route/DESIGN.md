description: Burnt paprika (#ef4f29) runs the entire visual argument — every add-to-cart button, every promotional badge, every hover state erupts from the same compressed flame against an ink-black (#1a1a1a) ground, while the rest of the canvas retreats into a family of near-white neutrals (#fafafa through #f4f4f4) that let gold, silver, and gemstone product photography read without competition. Simvoni, a display font exclusive to the brand's type stack, handles the editorial voice at large sizes — its distinct letterforms mark collection headers and hero lockups — while Poppins carries all navigation, body copy, and UI labels at weights that stay trim and contemporary. The palette is deliberately minimal: two warm near-blacks (#231815, #1a1a1a), a ladder of mid-grays for muted text and hairlines, and two accent outliers — a soft peach (#f9bda4) that softens promo surfaces and a muted sage green (#2d8a4e, surface tint #f0faf0) reserved for availability tags and success confirmations. Nothing in the gray ladder ventures to cool blue-gray; the entire spectrum tilts warm, keeping the terracotta primary emotionally coherent from hero to footer. Rounded values are restrained — `{rounded.xs}` on buttons and inputs, `{rounded.sm}` on cards — suggesting a brand that wants clean edges over the softness of a lifestyle marketplace. Product cards carry a tight grid, price typography sits at `{typography.price-display}` in near-black, and the struck-through compare-at price uses `{colors.muted}` so the discount reads clearly without the shouting red that fast-fashion brands rely on. The hero typically runs a full-bleed photograph with an overlay text column, and navigation defaults to a transparent-to-solid scroll behavior common on Shopify storefronts of this weight class.

## Components

### Buttons
**`button-primary`** — The add-to-cart and checkout CTA uses the brand's paprika orange (#ef4f29) fill with all-caps Poppins at 14px/600 weight and 0.5px tracking on a 4px radius. Hover transitions to `primary-hover` (#e8431e) and active to `primary-active` (#d32f2f); the disabled state bleaches to the complementary peach (#f9bda4), maintaining palette coherence rather than reaching for a generic gray.

**`button-secondary`** — Transparent fill with a 1.5px ink border that inverts to a full ink fill on hover, producing a clean reversal. Used for secondary actions such as "View Collection" or "Save to Wishlist" where a filled button would compete with the primary CTA.

**`button-ghost`** — Text-only, no border, muted (#737373) color at `{typography.button-sm}` scale. Appears for dismissals, "Continue Shopping", and low-priority navigation flows where a full button would overcrowd the layout.

### Text Inputs
**`text-input`** — White background with a mid-gray (#d0d0d0) border that steps to near-black on focus, signaling engagement without a jarring blue-ring convention. The 4px radius and 48px height match the primary button for vertical consistency in side-by-side form rows.

### Navigation
**`nav-bar`** — 64px tall sticky bar on white with a 1px hairline (#e5e5e5) base border, gaining a subtle drop-shadow on scroll via `nav-bar-scrolled`. Logo anchors left or center on mobile; desktop nav links (Poppins 14px/500) fan left with cart and search icons anchored right. An announcement bar above the nav typically runs an ink (#1a1a1a) fill with white promotional text.

### Product Cards
**`product-card`** — Square 1:1 image crop on a near-white (#f8f8f8) tile with 8px radius. Product name renders in `{typography.body-sm}`, current price in `{typography.price-display}` ink-colored, compare-at struck through in muted-mid (#888888). The `sale-badge` anchors to the top-left corner of the image as an absolute overlay; `new-badge` stacks below it when both apply simultaneously.

### Hero Banner
**`hero-banner`** — Full-bleed photography over an ink-toned ground (#0d0c0c) with a 35% dark scrim, white Simvoni headline at `{typography.display-xl}`, Poppins subhead at `{typography.body-md}`, and the primary CTA. Desktop minimum height is 560px; mobile collapses to a taller 70vh crop to preserve the product focal point.

### Badges
**`sale-badge`** / **`new-badge`** / **`stock-badge`** — All three share the same 4px radius, 3px/8px padding, and all-caps 11px Poppins/700 label. Sale uses the primary paprika; New uses ink fill; In-Stock uses the sage-green tint system (`{colors.accent-green-surface}` background, `{colors.accent-green}` text) to signal availability positively without competing with CTAs.

### Collection Header
**`collection-header`** — A neutral-surface (#f4f4f4) editorial block at the top of collection pages: muted all-caps `{typography.collection-label}` above the Simvoni display-md heading with an optional short description paragraph below. Establishes brand voice before the product grid begins.

### Price Row
**`price-row`** — Inline pair of current price (ink, `{typography.price-display}`) and compare-at price (muted-mid, struck through). When a sale is active the current price may adopt `{colors.primary}` to draw attention, gated by a Shopify theme setting.

### Footer
**`footer`** — Near-black (#1a1a1a) fill with white headlines and #bbbbbb muted link text in Poppins body-sm, organized into 3–4 link columns. Social icons appear as 24px glyph buttons at #bbbbbb fill. Email signup input sits above the link columns with a primary CTA button alongside.

### Search
**`search-input`** — Pill-shaped (#f4f4f4 background, `{rounded.full}`) search bar in the mobile header drawer and desktop slide-out overlay. Muted placeholder at body-md scale; magnifier icon left-padded inside the field.

### Filter Chips
**`filter-chip`** / **`filter-chip-active`** — Pill-shaped attribute selectors for metal type, price range, and style category. Default state uses white with a gray border; the active state inverts to a full ink fill. The `{rounded.full}` shape echoes the search pill, creating a visually unified filter row.

## Responsive Behavior

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile | < 744px | Single-column product grid; hamburger nav with slide-in drawer; hero becomes 70vh tall with centered text overlay; filter chips collapse to a horizontal scroll row |
| Tablet | 744–1128px | Two-column product grid; nav links may remain visible with condensed spacing; hero drops to 480px fixed height |
| Desktop | 1128–1440px | Three- or four-column product grid; full horizontal nav bar; filter sidebar appears left of the product grid |
| Wide | > 1440px | Grid max-width clamps at 1440px with auto horizontal margins; hero typography scales to full display-xl width |

### Touch Targets
- All buttons minimum 44×44px; primary CTA is 48px tall
- Filter chips minimum 36px tall for thumb comfort in a horizontal scroll row
- Product card tap area covers the full card tile, not just the image
- Cart and search icon buttons in the nav bar maintain minimum 44×44px hit areas

### Collapsing Strategy
- Desktop nav links collapse to a hamburger menu at < 744px; cart count badge persists in the mobile header
- Collection filter sidebar moves to a bottom-sheet drawer on mobile
- Hero text overlay shifts from a left-aligned column to full-width centered on mobile
- Footer four-column link grid collapses to accordion-style dropdowns on mobile

## Known Gaps

- Simvoni is present in the font stack but no size or weight specimen was extractable from static extraction — display scale values are inferred from typical Shopify editorial patterns
- The green accent pair (#2d8a4e / #f0faf0) may be Shopify UI chrome (success toasts, in-cart confirmations) rather than an intentional brand palette choice
- Exact hero module configuration (video loop vs. static image, crossfade vs. cut) was not determinable from color and font extraction
- Announcement bar background color inferred as ink (#1a1a1a); actual bar color was not isolated in the extracted palette
- No custom icon set or glyph library observed; icon implementation (inline SVG, sprite, or icon font) is unknown
- Dark-mode or alternate theme variant status is unconfirmed
- Product card hover behavior (image swap, zoom, quick-add drawer overlay) could not be confirmed from static extraction
- Motion and transition timing tokens are unspecified; animation durations are not extractable from this method
