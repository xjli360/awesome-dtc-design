  The add-to-cart button, the coil binding printed in every product shot, and the "New" launch badge all run the same charged pink — a fuchsia anchored near #F04E88 that functions as the brand's single organizing voltage across every surface. Erin Condren sells the proposition that color is a productivity technology: planners ship in more than a dozen colorway families, and the site's cover customizer — a horizontally scrolling swatch strip — is often the first interactive moment a new visitor has with the brand, before they've finished reading the product description. This means the UI carries an unusually literal relationship to the physical product; the digital swatches are the same inks that will arrive in the customer's mailbox. Rounded corners appear everywhere — {rounded.md} on cards, {rounded.full} on badge pills and swatch selectors — echoing the coil apertures and tabbed page-edges that make the planners recognizable at arm's length. Background surfaces stay bright white (#FFFFFF) or a barely-there blush ({colors.surface-soft}), so product photography — always shot open at a 45-degree angle, weekly spread visible, stickers in mid-application — reads as editorial rather than catalogue. The type system is a clean geometric sans-serif at modest weights, deferring to color rather than scale for hierarchy: a planner-grid section label and an e-commerce category chip use the same family, differentiated by hue and size rather than typeface changes. A multi-color horizontal stripe — running through the logo mark and repeated as section dividers — makes the visual handoff between digital and physical feel inevitable rather than designed. The footer and PDP sidebar carry the same color-coded chip taxonomy used inside the planners themselves: color is not a cosmetic layer here, it is the information architecture.

## Components

### Buttons

**`button-primary`** — Full pill shape (`{rounded.full}`) in signature fuchsia (`{colors.primary}`), 48px tall with 28px horizontal padding. Darkens to `{colors.primary-active}` on hover/press; fades to `{colors.primary-disabled}` when disabled. White label text in bold 16px with 0.5px letter-spacing gives a slight print-adjacent feel. Appears on every primary CTA: "Shop Now," "Add to Cart," "Customize Your Cover."

**`button-secondary`** — White fill with a 2px fuchsia border and the same pill radius. Hover adds the lightest blush (`{colors.surface-soft}`) as a fill. Sits alongside `button-primary` in hero sections and PDP sidebars for secondary actions like "Save to Wishlist" or "View Size Guide."

**`button-ghost`** — Transparent background with ink-colored label; used for tertiary actions and navigation-embedded text links. Hover shifts the label to `{colors.primary}` without adding a border or fill, keeping the interaction signal minimal.

### Text Input

**`text-input`** — Hairline border (`{colors.hairline}`) on a white field; border transitions to `{colors.primary}` on focus with no outer glow, keeping form controls visually quiet against the colorful surrounding UI. Rounded at `{rounded.sm}` (8px) rather than the pill radii used on buttons — this shape distinction separates form controls from action elements at a glance. Placeholder in `{colors.muted}`.

### Navigation

**`nav-bar`** — White canvas, 64px tall, with a 1px bottom border and no resting shadow. Logo sits left-aligned at 40px height; right zone carries account, wishlist, and cart icon-buttons. Mega-menu panels on hover span the full viewport width with category imagery and product subcategories. The `rainbow-stripe` appears immediately below the nav bar on marketing pages, functioning as a brand fingerprint rather than a structural separator. Collapses to a hamburger drawer below 744px.

### Product Card

**`product-card`** — 12px radius white card with 16px internal padding and a whisper shadow (8px blur, 6% black) that lifts on hover. Title in `{typography.title-sm}`, price in `{typography.price-sm}`. Cover image fills the upper zone flush to the card edge; badge pills (`badge-new`, `badge-sale`) overlay the top-left corner. A `swatch-strip` optionally renders below the image for inline colorway browsing — making the cover customizer present on the listing page before the customer reaches the PDP.

### Hero Banner

**`hero-banner`** — Blush-tinted (`{colors.surface-soft}`) zone, minimum 520px tall, with generous vertical padding (`{spacing.section}`). Display headline in `{typography.display-xl}`; supporting copy in `{typography.body-md}`. A 4px rainbow gradient bar runs at the section's top or bottom edge, anchoring the seasonal color story. CTA pair — `button-primary` + `button-secondary` — sits below the body copy with 24px gap between them.

### Rainbow Stripe

**`rainbow-stripe`** — A 4px full-width gradient bar progressing from `{colors.primary}` through `{colors.accent-coral}`, `{colors.accent-yellow}`, `{colors.accent-green}`, `{colors.accent-teal}`, to `{colors.accent-purple}`. Applied as the top accent on hero sections, between major content zones, and as the footer's opening cap. This is the most immediate brand signal in the digital system — it maps directly to the rainbow coil motif on the physical planner and requires no text to communicate brand identity.

### Badges

**`badge-new`** — Pill chip in `{colors.badge-new}` (primary fuchsia) with white uppercase label in `{typography.badge-label}` (11px/700, tracked at 0.5px). **`badge-sale`** — Identical pill shape in `{colors.badge-sale}` (coral). Both overlay product card images at the top-left with 3px vertical / 10px horizontal padding. Used only for genuine launches and price reductions — sparing use preserves signal strength across a catalog with many colorways.

### Customizer Swatch

**`customizer-swatch`** — 32px circle at `{rounded.full}`, showing a cover colorway fill. Selected state gains a 3px `{colors.ink}` ring offset by a 2px transparent gap from the circle edge. Unselected swatches carry a 2px transparent border to maintain consistent spacing. Hover scales to 1.1×. Rendered inside `swatch-strip`: a horizontally scrollable row at all breakpoints, 8px gap, no visible scrollbar. This interaction is Erin Condren's most brand-specific UX moment — it mirrors the physical act of choosing a planner cover before committing to purchase.

### Collection Chip

**`collection-chip`** — Pill-shaped filter tag in `{colors.surface-soft}` with body-colored label in `{typography.button-sm}`. Active state flips to `{colors.primary}` background with white text. Used on collection landing pages to filter by format (Daily, Weekly, Monthly), cover style, and size. These chips replicate the color-coded section tab logic from inside the planners themselves, making the e-commerce taxonomy feel native to the product.

### Planner Tab

**`planner-tab`** — Used within PDP and collection pages to switch between planner layout views (Horizontal Weekly, Vertical Weekly, Monthly). Inactive tabs show muted text on white; active tab uses `{colors.primary}` fill with white text and an underline accent. Rounded at `{rounded.sm}` to maintain the softer geometry consistent with the rest of the system.

### Newsletter Signup

**`newsletter-signup`** — Blush-tinted module (`{colors.surface-soft}`) with 12px radius container and 48px vertical padding. Display headline in `{typography.display-md}`; body copy in `{typography.body-md}`. Single email input with `button-primary` inline on desktop, stacked on mobile. Typically appears between collection rows on the homepage as a soft interrupt without a modal or overlay.

### Footer

**`footer`** — Dark (`{colors.ink}`) background providing the only high-contrast zone on an otherwise light site, making it a strong visual anchor. Topped by the `rainbow-stripe` cap. Navigation columns in `{typography.body-sm}`, link hover in white. Dividers at 12% white opacity. Social icon row and legal text at base in `{typography.caption}`. The dark-on-light reversal here is abrupt by design — it signals a full stop after the colorful product experience above.

## Responsive Behavior

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile | < 744px | Single-column layout; hamburger nav drawer; swatch-strip stays horizontal-scroll; hero stacks text above image; product grid 2-up |
| Tablet | 744–1128px | 2–3 column product grid; nav retains horizontal links but drops mega-menu to simplified dropdowns; hero goes side-by-side |
| Desktop | 1128–1440px | 4-column product grid; full mega-menu panels; hero gains 80px horizontal padding; rainbow-stripe and badge overlays fully visible |
| Wide | > 1440px | Content capped at ~1440px max-width; hero and section padding increase to maintain reading measure; grid stays 4-up |

### Touch Targets

- All buttons minimum 48px tall; pill radius adds perceived tap width without explicit padding increase
- Swatch circles are 32px × 32px with 8px gap — dense but tappable; selected-state ring aids identification without requiring label text
- Nav links minimum 44px tap height inside the mobile drawer
- Collection chips 36px tall on mobile, collapsing to a horizontal scroll row when they overflow the viewport

### Collapsing Strategy

- Top nav collapses to hamburger drawer at 744px; category mega-menus become nested accordion sections inside the drawer
- Swatch strip remains horizontal-scroll at all breakpoints; never wraps to a grid (preserving the tactile customizer feel)
- Hero content stacks vertically below 744px; image moves above copy to lead with product imagery
- Product card grid: 4-up → 3-up → 2-up as viewport narrows; single-up only in narrow modal or drawer contexts
- Footer columns collapse from 4-column → 2-column at tablet, single column with accordion sections on mobile

## Known Gaps

- **No colors extracted** — erincondren.com appears to load design tokens via JavaScript or is behind anti-bot protection at time of extraction; zero hex values were captured. All colors in this file are inferred from widely-available brand imagery and marketing materials, not live site data. Treat as best-guess approximations; validate against live computed styles before production use.
- **Primary hex unconfirmed** — The fuchsia (#F04E88) is derived from brand imagery and packaging; the true production hex may differ by several lightness or saturation points.
- **No fonts extracted** — The Nunito Sans / Proxima Nova fallback stack is inferred from visual inspection of brand assets. The site almost certainly loads a licensed or custom typeface; confirm exact font name, weights, and loading strategy by inspecting network requests on the live site.
- **Accent palette hex values unconfirmed** — The brand uses 5–6 recurring accent hues; the precise production hex for each (teal, purple, coral, yellow, green) is unverified. Gradient stop order in `rainbow-stripe` matches commonly published brand assets but should be confirmed.
- **Custom illustration and icon set not captured** — Erin Condren uses illustrated icons, sticker-motif graphics, and seasonal spot illustrations throughout. No icon sizing or stroke-weight tokens are defined here.
- **Animation and transition tokens absent** — Cover-flip animations, swatch hover transitions, and the customizer scroll behavior are brand-signature micro-interactions; no duration, easing, or spring tokens were extractable.
- **Dark mode** — No dark-mode variant observed in brand materials; assumed light-only unless confirmed otherwise.
