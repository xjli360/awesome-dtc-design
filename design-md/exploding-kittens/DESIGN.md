name: Exploding Kittens
description: A game brand that weaponizes the warm, off-white canvas of #fcf8ee against the absolute black of #0f0f0f, creating a visual tension that mirrors the tension of drawing from a deck that might blow up in your face. The brand’s signature voltage comes from a blood-red #840815 that appears in product badges, card backs, and the iconic exploding kitten icon itself — a color so specific it reads as both playful and dangerous. Type runs Epilogue at moderate weights (400–600) for body and Instrument Sans for display headlines, with bebas-neue-pro reserved for explosive sale banners and limited-edition drops. The site uses a near-black #0c0c0c for primary text on the off-white canvas, with #767676 and #4d4d4d as muted stepping stones. Accent colors arrive like wild cards: a marigold #ffd045 for star ratings and “NEW” badges, a sage #aaccaa for expansion-pack headers, and a deep navy #272d45 for footer and legal text. Product cards float on the #fcf8ee canvas with soft shadows and {rounded.md} corners, while CTA buttons sit in full #840815 with white text — no ambiguity about which action detonates the game. The overall feel is a clean, slightly irreverent game shop: high contrast, generous whitespace, and color used as a surprise mechanic rather than decoration.

## Components

### Buttons
**`button-primary`** — The primary action button, rendered in deep blood-red #840815 with white text. Used for “Add to Cart,” “Buy Now,” and primary checkout flows. On hover, darkens to #6a0611 with a subtle scale transform. Disabled state uses a muted pink #d4a0a5 to indicate inactivity. All primary buttons use {rounded.sm} (8px) corners and 14px vertical padding for a substantial feel.

**`button-secondary`** — An outlined variant on the off-white canvas with dark ink text. Uses a 1.5px solid hairline border (#e5e5e5) that darkens to #4d4d4d on hover. Used for “Learn More,” “View Details,” and secondary cart actions. Active state fills with the hairline color.

**`button-accent-marigold`** — A high-energy accent button in #ffd045 with dark ink text. Reserved for limited-time offers, subscription upsells, and “NEW” product launches. The marigold creates strong contrast against the off-white canvas without the danger-signal of the primary red.

**`button-accent-sale`** — A bright red #df1e27 button used exclusively for clearance and sale events. White text, same sizing as primary. Creates urgency without competing with the primary brand red.

**`button-pill`** — A fully rounded variant of the primary button, used for filter tags, category pills, and mobile navigation. Smaller padding (10px 24px) and {rounded.full} corners make it feel like a game token.

### Cards
**`product-card`** — A white card floating on the off-white canvas with a subtle box shadow (0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)). The product image fills the top with {rounded.md} on top corners only. Title sits below in {typography.title-sm} with the price rendered in the brand red. A “NEW” or “SALE” badge overlays the top-left of the image. On hover, the card lifts with a deeper shadow and the CTA button appears.

### Navigation
**`top-nav`** — A fixed 72px bar on the off-white canvas. The Exploding Kittens logo (an exploding kitten icon + wordmark) sits left, with nav links in {typography.nav-link} centered. A search icon and cart icon sit right. On scroll, a thin 1px hairline border appears at the bottom. Mobile collapses to a hamburger menu with a full-screen overlay.

**`nav-link`** — Inline text links with 8px horizontal padding. Active state uses the brand red #840815. Hover adds a subtle underline animation.

### Badges
**`badge-new`** — A marigold #ffd045 pill with dark text, used to flag new products and expansions. Compact at 4px 8px padding with {rounded.xs} corners and uppercase 11px bold type.

**`badge-sale`** — A bright red #df1e27 pill with white text, used for clearance items. Same sizing as the new badge but with urgency color.

**`badge-expansion`** — A sage #aaccaa pill with dark text, used to denote expansion packs and add-ons. The sage green signals “additional content” without competing with the primary red.

### Forms
**`search-bar`** — A fully rounded input field on white background with a 1px hairline border. 48px height with 12px 20px padding. On focus, the border shifts to the brand red and a subtle ring appears. Placeholder text in {colors.muted-soft}.

**`quantity-selector`** — A compact 40px control with minus/plus buttons flanking a numeric display. Used in cart and product detail pages. The buttons have {rounded.sm} corners and the active state uses the brand red.

### Footer
**`footer`** — A deep navy #272d45 band at the bottom of every page. Links render in a muted gray-blue #d3d4dd and shift to marigold #ffd045 on hover. The footer contains site map links, social icons, and legal text. A thin 1px hairline in #676986 separates sections.

## Responsive Behavior

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile | < 744px | Single-column product grid, hamburger nav, stacked footer, hero banner reduces to 32px font, search bar collapses to icon-only |
| Tablet | 744–1128px | Two-column product grid, expanded nav links, hero banner at 36px, search bar full-width in nav |
| Desktop | 1128–1440px | Three-column product grid, full nav, hero banner at 48px, search bar in nav with icon |
| Wide | > 1440px | Four-column product grid, max-width container at 1440px, hero banner centered with larger margins |

### Touch Targets
- All buttons and interactive elements minimum 44px height
- Nav links minimum 40px tap area
- Quantity selector buttons minimum 36px tap area
- Product card CTA buttons minimum 44px height
- Search icon minimum 44px tap area
- Cart icon minimum 44px tap area

### Collapsing Strategy
- Top nav collapses to hamburger menu below 744px
- Product grid collapses from 4 columns to 1 column on mobile
- Footer link columns collapse to single column below 744px
- Hero banner text reduces font size progressively
- Search bar becomes icon-only on mobile, expanding to full input on tap
- Category strip becomes horizontally scrollable on mobile

## Known Gaps

- Hover and focus states for most components were inferred from common patterns rather than extracted from the live site
- Error styling for form inputs (validation colors, error messages) could not be reliably extracted
- Dark mode is not present on the live site; all colors are light-mode only
- The extracted font list includes several Shopify widget fonts (oke-widget-icons) and fallbacks that may not be brand-specific
- The extracted hex list includes many colors that are likely from third-party widgets (Klarna, Afterpay, social icons) rather than the brand palette — the primary brand colors (#840815, #fcf8ee, #0f0f0f, #ffd045, #aaccaa, #272d45) were identified by frequency and distinctiveness
- Sub-brand palettes for specific game expansions (e.g., Zombie Kittens, Imploding Kittens) could not be extracted
- Animation durations, easing curves, and transition properties were not extracted
- Shadow values (box-shadow, drop-shadow) were not reliably extractable from the live site
- The bebas-neue-pro font family appears in limited contexts (likely sale banners and hero text) but exact usage rules are inferred
- Sainte-Colombe font appears in the extracted list but its usage context is unclear — may be used for decorative or limited-edition content
