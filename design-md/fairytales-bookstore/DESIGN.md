description: A storybook-green (#36855c) doorframe against a warm gray (#f8f8f8) storefront — the brand’s primary color reads like a forest canopy, not a corporate green, and it appears on every button, badge, and navigation accent. The palette is deliberately muted: body text sits in #2b333f, a deep slate that softens reading fatigue, while #73859f and #919191 handle secondary labels and metadata with a quiet, almost chalky restraint. The single burst of warmth comes from #ffe53b, a marigold yellow used sparingly on sale badges and story-time callouts — it lands like a bookmark left in a favorite page. Typography runs Inter at modest weights (400–600), with display headlines at 24–28px and body copy at 15–16px, never shouting. Cards and buttons use {rounded.sm} (8px) corners — soft enough for a children’s store, not so round that they feel toy-like. The checkout flow introduces #006aff (a standard blue) and #d92b2b (an error red), but the brand’s own voice stays in the green-gray spectrum. The overall mood is calm, literate, and tactile without being precious — a bookstore that trusts its inventory and its readers.

## Components

### Buttons
**`button-primary`** — The primary call-to-action, used for "Add to Cart", "Checkout", and "Subscribe". Rendered in the brand's forest green (#36855c) with white text and 8px rounded corners. On hover, darkens to #2c6f4d. When disabled, fades to a pale sage (#a3d4b8) with white text.

**`button-secondary`** — An outlined variant for secondary actions like "View Details" or "Save for Later". White background with a 1px green border. Hover fills the background with a soft gray (#f2f2f2) and darkens the border to the active green.

**`button-accent-marigold`** — A warm yellow (#ffe53b) button used sparingly for high-urgency actions like "Limited Edition" or "Story Time Registration". Text is dark (#2b333f) for contrast. No hover variant defined — used as a single-state accent.

### Cards
**`product-card`** — A white card with a subtle drop shadow (0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)) and 8px rounded corners. Contains a product image (full-width, no internal padding), title, author, price, and optional badges. On hover, the shadow deepens to 0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.12). No border — relies entirely on shadow for separation from the canvas.

**`hero-banner`** — A full-width promotional banner with a soft sage (#d7f5e6) background and dark text. Used for seasonal promotions, author events, and story-time announcements. Internal padding is 48px horizontal, 32px vertical. The banner may include a headline (display-xl), a subhead (body-md), and a button.

### Badges
**`badge-sale`** — A marigold yellow (#ffe53b) pill with uppercase 11px text. Used on product cards to indicate discounts or promotions. Text is dark (#2b333f) for readability. Padding is tight (2px 8px) to sit neatly in the top-right corner of a product image.

**`badge-new`** — A soft sage (#d7f5e6) pill with strong sage text (#4e8e4a). Indicates newly arrived titles. Same sizing and positioning as the sale badge.

**`badge-out-of-stock`** — A neutral gray (#f2f2f2) pill with muted text (#73859f). Indicates unavailable items. Same sizing.

**`story-time-badge`** — A soft marigold (#f1f37f) pill with full rounding and 4px 12px padding. Used in navigation or headers to highlight upcoming story-time events. Text is small (12px) and dark.

### Navigation
**`nav-bar`** — A 64px white bar with a subtle bottom border (#e6e6e6). Contains the store logo (left), nav links (center), and search/cart icons (right). Active nav links show a 2px green underline. On mobile, the nav collapses into a hamburger menu.

**`search-bar`** — A fully rounded (9999px) white input with a 1px gray border. On focus, the border becomes a 2px green stroke. Used for searching titles, authors, or categories. Includes a magnifying glass icon on the left.

### Forms
**`text-input`** — Standard text input for forms (newsletter signup, contact forms, checkout). White background, 8px rounded corners, 1px gray border. On focus, border becomes 2px green. Error state uses a red (#d92b2b) border. Height is 44px for comfortable touch interaction.

### Footer
**`footer-section`** — A deep navy (#2b333f) footer with white text. Contains columns for store info, customer service, social links, and a newsletter signup. Links are muted gray (#919191) and use the link typography. Padding is 64px top and bottom.

## Responsive Behavior

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile | < 744px | Nav collapses to hamburger; product cards stack in single column; hero banner reduces padding to 24px; search bar moves below nav; footer columns stack vertically |
| Tablet | 744–1128px | Nav links visible but condensed; product cards in 2-column grid; hero banner at 32px padding; footer in 2-column layout |
| Desktop | 1128–1440px | Full nav with all links; product cards in 3- or 4-column grid; hero banner at full padding; footer in 4-column layout |
| Wide | > 1440px | Max-width container (1440px) centered; product cards in 4-column grid; extra whitespace on sides |

### Touch Targets
- All interactive elements (buttons, links, inputs) have a minimum height of 44px.
- Nav bar hamburger icon is 48px × 48px.
- Search bar height is 44px.
- Product card tap targets (title, author, price) are at least 44px tall within the card.

### Collapsing Strategy
- On mobile (< 744px), the top nav collapses to a hamburger menu with a slide-out drawer.
- Product filters (category, age range, price) collapse into a "Filter" button that opens a modal or bottom sheet.
- Footer columns collapse from 4 columns to 2 (tablet) to 1 (mobile).
- Hero banner text reduces from display-xl to display-md on mobile.

## Known Gaps

- Hover states for all components are inferred from common patterns; actual extracted hover colors are not available.
- Error styling for forms (error messages, validation icons) is not extracted — only the error border color (#d92b2b) is known.
- The extracted color list includes many generic web colors (#006aff, #d92b2b, #3374ff, #ff7734) that are likely from checkout widgets, social icons, or stock photography — not brand colors. The brand's true palette is assumed to be the green (#36855c), slate (#2b333f), muted blues (#73859f, #919191), and marigold (#ffe53b).
- Font weights and sizes are estimated from typical Inter usage; exact extracted values are not available.
- Dark mode is not supported — no dark theme colors were extracted.
- Sub-brand or seasonal color palettes are not documented.
- Animation and transition durations are not specified.
- The extracted font list includes "VideoJS" which is a video player font, not a brand font — it has been excluded.
- No extracted data for modal, tooltip, or dropdown styling.
