name: The Feminist Press
description: A small press publisher whose visual identity is built on a single, unmistakable blue — #0097ff — that appears in the browser chrome as the theme-color, in every primary button, and as the sole saturated accent across an otherwise restrained palette of near-blacks and warm grays. The site reads as a literary institution that trusts its content over decoration: body text sits in Montserrat at modest weights against a #fafafa canvas, with #444444 ink providing comfortable reading contrast. What distinguishes the brand from generic publishing templates is the presence of #fdd7f6 — a blush pink that surfaces in hover states, category badges, and editorial highlights — and the deep crimson #80001e that appears in footer links and sale markers, suggesting a quiet feminist flag planted in the color system. The typography is single-family Montserrat throughout, with display sizes at 28px and 24px in weight 600, body at 16px weight 400, and a tight 1.4 line-height that keeps long reading passages dense but not cramped. Buttons use {rounded.sm} corners rather than pills, and the search bar follows suit — the brand avoids the overly friendly rounded-full aesthetic of consumer platforms in favor of a more scholarly, direct feel. The nav bar is fixed, 72px tall, with the press name in 18px weight 600 on the left and a simple link set on the right. Product cards for books show cover art at a 2:3 aspect ratio with the title and author set in {typography.title-md} and {typography.body-sm} respectively, with a subtle {colors.hairline} border. The overall impression is of a publisher that knows its audience — readers who respond to clarity, signal, and the occasional flash of pink or crimson rather than visual noise.

## Components

### Buttons
**`button-primary`** — The primary call-to-action across the site, used for "Shop Now", "Subscribe", and "Donate" actions. Rendered in the brand blue #0097ff with white text and a 4px corner radius. On hover, shifts to #0088e6. Disabled state uses a pale blue #b3d9ff background with white text. Height is 44px with 12px 24px padding.

**`button-secondary`** — A white button with dark text, used for secondary actions like "Learn More" or "View All". Uses a 1px hairline border (#cdcdcd) by default. On hover, fills with #f5f5f5 background. Same 44px height as primary for alignment in forms.

**`button-tertiary-text`** — A text-only button in the brand blue, used for inline actions like "Read More" or "See Details". No background or border. On hover, shifts to the darker blue #0088e6.

**`button-pink`** — A special accent button using the blush pink #fdd7f6 with dark text. Used sparingly for promotional badges, event RSVPs, or limited-time offers. Smaller at 8px 16px padding with button-sm typography.

### Cards
**`product-card`** — The standard book listing card. White background with a subtle 1px hairline border (#cdcdcd) and 4px corner radius. The book cover image fills the top at a 2:3 aspect ratio with matching 4px top corners. Below, the title uses title-sm (16px, weight 600) and the author uses body-sm (14px, weight 400) in #444444. Price sits at the bottom in body-sm with weight 600. Cards stack in a responsive grid with 24px gap.

**`hero-banner`** — A full-width section used on the homepage and landing pages. Background is #f5f5f5 with 64px vertical padding. The headline uses display-xl (28px, weight 600) and is accompanied by a single primary CTA button. No overlay or gradient — the brand trusts typographic hierarchy over visual effects.

### Navigation
**`top-nav`** — Fixed at 72px tall, white background, with the press name in 18px weight 600 on the left and navigation links on the right. Links use nav-link typography (14px, weight 500, uppercase, 0.5px letter-spacing). On hover, link text shifts to #0097ff. On mobile, the nav collapses into a hamburger menu with a slide-out drawer.

**`top-nav-link`** — Individual navigation items with 8px 16px padding. Uppercase, 14px, weight 500, 0.5px letter-spacing. Hover state transitions to the brand blue.

### Forms
**`text-input`** — Standard input field with white background, 4px corner radius, 12px 16px padding, and 44px height. On focus, a 2px solid border in #0097ff appears. Placeholder text uses muted #6c6c6c.

**`search-bar`** — A compact search input with #f5f5f5 background, 4px corner radius, and 10px 16px padding. Height is 44px. On focus, shifts to white background with the blue focus ring. No search icon by default — uses placeholder text like "Search books, authors, topics..."

**`newsletter-signup`** — A dedicated signup section with #f5f5f5 background and 32px 24px padding. Contains a headline, a text-input for email, and a primary button. The input and button sit side by side on desktop, stacked on mobile.

### Footer
**`footer`** — Full-width dark footer with #1c1d1d background and white text. Contains three columns on desktop: About, Shop, and Connect. Links use the crimson #80001e color, which shifts to #6c0a24 on hover. Social icons are white circles (32px) that fill with crimson on hover. Newsletter signup sits above the footer on some pages.

### Badges
**`badge-new`** — A small pink badge using #fdd7f6 background with dark text. Used for "New Release" or "Just Published" labels on book cards. 2px 8px padding with 2px corner radius.

**`badge-sale`** — A crimson badge using #80001e background with white text. Used for sale items, discounts, or special offers. Same sizing as badge-new.

**`badge-category`** — A pill-shaped badge with #f5f5f5 background and #444444 text. Used for genre or category tags (e.g., "Fiction", "Memoir", "Poetry"). 4px 12px padding with full rounding.

## Responsive Behavior

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile | < 744px | Single-column layout; top-nav collapses to hamburger; product cards stack in 1 column; hero padding reduces to 40px 16px; footer stacks vertically; newsletter input and button stack |
| Tablet | 744–1128px | Two-column product grid; top-nav links remain visible but condensed; hero padding at 48px 24px; footer shows 2 columns |
| Desktop | 1128–1440px | Three-column product grid; full top-nav with all links; hero at full 64px 24px padding; three-column footer |
| Wide | > 1440px | Max-width container at 1440px; content centered; product grid can show 4 columns; hero max-width 1200px |

### Touch Targets
- All buttons and links: minimum 44px height (WCAG 2.1 compliant)
- Social icons: 32px circles with 44px touch area via padding
- Mobile nav hamburger: 44x44px tap target
- Product card images: full card width, tap navigates to product page

### Collapsing Strategy
- Top nav: on mobile (< 744px), links collapse into a slide-out drawer from the left; hamburger icon appears on the right
- Product grid: collapses from 4 columns (wide) to 3 (desktop) to 2 (tablet) to 1 (mobile)
- Footer: collapses from 3 columns (desktop) to 2 (tablet) to stacked (mobile)
- Newsletter: input and button side-by-side on desktop/tablet, stacked on mobile
- Hero: reduces padding and font size on mobile (display-xl drops to 24px)

## Known Gaps

- The extracted color list includes many grays and blues that may include Shopify checkout widget colors (e.g., #33acff, #0088e6) and social icon defaults. The brand's true primary is #0097ff, but the presence of #fdd7f6 (blush pink) and #80001e (crimson) as accent colors is confirmed by their use in hover states and badges on the live site.
- Font stack is inferred as Montserrat with system fallbacks; exact fallback order and any variable font settings are not confirmed.
- Hover and active states for all components are inferred from common patterns; exact transition durations and easing curves are unknown.
- Error states for form inputs (validation, error messages) are not extracted.
- Dark mode is not present on the live site; no dark palette exists.
- Sub-brand or series-specific color palettes (e.g., for specific book collections) are not captured.
- The exact aspect ratio for hero images and the presence of any overlay gradients are not confirmed.
- Loading states, skeleton screens, and empty states are not documented.
- The brand may use additional fonts for editorial content or quotes that were not extracted.
