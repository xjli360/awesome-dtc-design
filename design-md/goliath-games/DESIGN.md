name: Goliath Games
description: Compressed military lettering and a board-game color riot coexist under one roof — Goliath runs exclusively on D-DIN, an industrial sans-serif that originated in German engineering manuals and arrived at game-night headlines via its legibility at distance. D-DIN Condensed handles the loudest display work, stacking uppercase titles at 48–64px in a way that fills the viewport the same way box art fills a retail shelf. The deep navy ground (#0d1e63) anchors the header, footer, and hero zones in a single gravitational field, giving every product grid a dark sky to erupt against. Red (#e11b22) drives every primary CTA, sale callout, and active-state indicator — one signal color doing all the commercial lifting. Below it, electric yellow (#ffdd00), arcade green (#75c32c), citrus orange (#ff6900), and pale pink (#f78da7) rotate through category badges and product chips, functioning as a visual taxonomy where different age groups and game types carry different accent hues without requiring additional iconography. A pale mint-cream surface (#f2fbe4, {colors.surface-soft}) appears behind category landing grids, dropping the chroma just enough for comfortable browsing without abandoning the brand's saturated ground. Geometry leans utilitarian — cards and inputs carry {rounded.sm} at 8px, just enough softness to read as contemporary without dissolving the industrial frame that D-DIN's letterforms set up. Primary buttons go harder at {rounded.xs} (4px), a nearly rectangular shape that communicates action over invitation. Product metadata — age ratings in navy-filled chips, player counts in pale-surface pills at {rounded.full} — arrives in D-DIN Condensed at badge-label weight, tiny specs that carry real decision-making information without pulling the eye from product photography. What holds the visual system together across a catalog spanning toddler games and adult party titles is that #0d1e63 navy, which operates the way a game box's dark background operates: every other color reads more decisively against it than it would on white.

## Components

### Buttons

**`button-primary`** — Red (#e11b22) fill on a near-square {rounded.xs} (4px) corner, uppercase D-DIN at 16px/700 with 0.5px tracking. The near-rectangular shape reads as a buzzer rather than a cloud tap — pressing it should feel decisive. Active state darkens to `cta-active` (#cf2e2e); hover lifts 2px with a soft red-tinted drop shadow. Disabled state uses the pale pink `cta-disabled` (#f78da7).

**`button-navy`** — Identical geometry to `button-primary` but filled with the primary navy (#0d1e63). Used in hero zones and dark-ground contexts where red would read as alarm rather than invitation. On-primary white text keeps the same uppercase D-DIN spec. Pair with `button-primary` when two actions share a hero zone.

**`button-secondary`** — Canvas fill, 2px navy border, navy text. Matches `button-primary` at 48px height so the two sit level in side-by-side button pairs. Uppercase D-DIN preserves visual parity; hover fills the border color inward to a light `surface-strong` tint.

**`button-ghost`** — Transparent fill, 2px white border, white text. Appears exclusively on navy and charcoal backgrounds — hero panels, footer CTAs — where a colored button would break the dark-ground composition. Not for use on light surfaces.

### Navigation

**`nav-bar`** — 64px navy (#0d1e63) bar with the Goliath logo at 40px height on the left, uppercase D-DIN 700 category links at center, and utility icons (search, cart, account) at right in white. Active items carry a `cta` red underline indicator. Mobile below 744px collapses to a hamburger that opens a full-screen navy drawer, retaining the `category-tab-active` / `category-tab-inactive` chip row as a horizontal scroll rail.

**`nav-announcement-strip`** — 36px charcoal (#32373c) band above the main nav for sitewide promotions. White or `accent-yellow` text on the dark ground maintains contrast without borrowing the red signal reserved for CTAs.

### Product Cards

**`product-card`** — White `surface-card` tile with {rounded.sm} (8px) corners and a `hairline` border. Product image occupies the top ~60% on a white image field; title renders in `title-sm` (16px/700); price in `price-display` (22px/700). If a sale price exists, the original price renders in `price-sale` with strikethrough alongside the discounted price in `price-display`. Badges (`sale-badge`, `new-badge`, `age-rating-chip`) stack in the image's top-left corner. Hover lifts with `hoverShadow` — a 4px navy-tinted shadow that avoids the warm glow typical of lifestyle brands.

### Badges and Chips

**`sale-badge`** — Red (#e11b22) fill, white `badge-label` text, {rounded.xs}. Hard-edged and high-contrast; functions as a stop-sign interrupt in the product grid. Never stack two colored badges — `sale-badge` and `new-badge` should be mutually exclusive.

**`new-badge`** — Electric yellow (#ffdd00) fill, near-black `badge-label` text, {rounded.xs}. Lower urgency temperature than the sale badge — announces novelty without demanding action. Yellow on near-black achieves 7:1+ contrast.

**`age-rating-chip`** — 40×40px navy square, white D-DIN Condensed numerals ("8+", "12+"). Fixed dimensions keep rating information scannable across the grid at a glance, matching how physical PEGI icons work on box art. Render at {rounded.xs} to match the board geometry of the card.

**`player-count-chip`** — Pale-navy `surface-strong` (#ebf1ff) pill at {rounded.full} carrying "2–4 players" copy in `badge-label`. Softer than the age chip; reads as informational rather than regulatory. Place below the title, not in the image zone.

**`category-tab-active`** / **`category-tab-inactive`** — Active tab fills `cta` red with white `button-sm` text; inactive sits on `surface-strong` with primary navy text. Together they form the category filter row above product grids. Gap between tabs: {spacing.xs}. On mobile, the row becomes a horizontal scrollable strip.

### Hero

**`hero-banner`** — Full-width navy zone at minimum 480px, carrying a D-DIN Condensed `display-xl` headline in white and a `display-sm` subheadline. CTA renders as `button-primary` (red). Right half of the hero may carry a product or lifestyle image at natural opacity; the navy left half ensures text legibility without a scrim.

**`hero-category-landing`** — Softer entry for category browse pages: `surface-soft` (#f2fbe4) background, `ink` text, `display-md` headline at 36px. Used when the full navy-and-red hero voltage would overwhelm a browsing context. No minimum height constraint — content-driven.

### Search and Forms

**`search-bar`** — 44px tall, {rounded.sm}, `canvas` fill with a left-aligned magnifying-glass icon in `muted` gray. Placeholder copy in `muted`. Border shifts from `hairline` to `primary` navy on focus. On desktop the search bar sits in the nav-bar icon area as an expand-in-place field; on mobile it becomes a full-width row below the hamburger trigger.

**`text-input`** — Shares `search-bar` geometry. Focus ring: 2px `primary` navy border. Used in checkout, account registration, and contact forms. Error state swaps border to `cta` red with an inline error message in `body-sm`.

### Promotional

**`promotional-ribbon`** — Full-width yellow (#ffdd00) strip at 40px carrying uppercase `button-sm` copy in near-black. Appears above the nav-bar or inlined within hero zones for seasonal events. Never stacks with the `nav-announcement-strip` — one announcement surface is active at a time.

### Footer

**`footer`** — Navy (#0d1e63) ground with four-column link grid. Column headings in white `title-sm`; body links in `hairline` gray `body-sm`; link hover brightens to canvas white. Social icons via Font Awesome 5 Free at 20px in `hairline` color. Goliath logo renders at reduced size in the leftmost column above the legal copy in `caption`.

## Responsive Behavior

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile | < 744px | Single-column product grid; nav collapses to hamburger drawer; hero headline drops to `display-lg` (48px); age-rating and player-count chips stack below product title rather than overlaying the image; category tab row becomes horizontal scroll strip |
| Tablet | 744–1128px | Two-column product grid; nav shows primary category links, hides secondary utility links; hero retains two-column layout at `display-xl` with reduced padding |
| Desktop | 1128–1440px | Three- to four-column product grid; full nav with all category links and utility icons; hero at full 480px minimum height with `display-xl` at 64px |
| Wide | > 1440px | Max-width container centered at 1440px; product grid may expand to five columns; hero background image scales without stretching; footer columns stay at four |

### Touch Targets

- All buttons minimum 48px height; icon buttons and nav icons minimum 44px touch zone
- Age-rating chips are 40×40px visual but carry a 48×48px invisible touch target on mobile
- Category tab chips use {rounded.full} pill shape on player-count chips to maximize perceived tap area relative to small physical size
- Footer links minimum 44px vertical tap zone via padding compensation

### Collapsing Strategy

- Navigation collapses in priority order: secondary utility links (Help, Track Order) first, then full nav becomes hamburger below 744px; category tabs move to horizontal scroll row at tablet
- Promotional ribbon shortens copy to a single line on mobile; overflow text is hidden with ellipsis rather than reflowing to two lines
- Hero switches from side-by-side (text left, image right) to stacked (image below text) below 744px; min-height drops to 320px
- Footer columns collapse from four across to two at tablet and a single accordion-expand list on mobile
- Product card badge stack collapses to a maximum of two overlapping chips on mobile with a "+N" overflow indicator if more exist

## Known Gaps

- Exact logo dimensions, clearspace rules, and wordmark color variants (white vs. navy lockup) were not extractable from metadata alone
- The full category-to-accent-color mapping (which hex maps to which game category or age tier) could not be confirmed from extraction
- Hover and focus transition timing values (easing curves, duration in ms) were not captured
- Whether D-DIN is self-hosted, loaded via a font CDN, or licensed per-seat, and the associated fallback rendering behavior on Windows, was not confirmed
- Exact mobile nav height in open-drawer state and whether a sticky-on-scroll nav variant exists were not captured
- Product image aspect ratio standards (1:1 square, 4:3, or freeform) could not be determined from metadata
- The search experience pattern (modal overlay, inline expand, or dedicated search results page) was not extractable
- Whether the multicolor accent palette ({colors.accent-green}, {colors.accent-orange}, {colors.accent-teal}) maps to specific branded product lines or is applied contextually was not determinable
