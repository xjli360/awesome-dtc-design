name: Hello Bello
description: A playful, affordable baby-care brand that wraps its deep purple #300064 around a pastel rainbow of accents — #ff6dff bubblegum pink, #00fc87 mint, #fffe64 marigold — and trusts a clean white canvas to keep it from feeling like a cartoon. The primary purple carries every CTA, badge, and navigation bar, while the secondary #7a60ff provides a lighter hover state that still reads as unmistakably Hello Bello. Product photography and illustration share space generously, with soft pill-shaped buttons ({rounded.full}) and card corners ({rounded.lg}) that mirror the gentle curves of baby products themselves. The brand uses Alexandria as its display and body face, a rounded geometric sans-serif that feels approachable without sacrificing legibility at small sizes. The extracted palette reveals a system built on high-contrast purple-on-white for primary actions, muted grays (#e5e7eb, #9ca3af) for secondary borders and disabled states, and a warm lavender #f2edff for soft surfaces. The checkout flow introduces #0056a1 (a Shopify-standard blue) and various payment-widget colors, but the brand's own identity is unmistakably purple-first, with pink and green as joyful accent voltages. The overall mood is "trustworthy whimsy" — the purple says premium, the pastels say baby, and the white space says we're not trying to sell you anything you don't need.

## Components

### Buttons

**`button-primary`** — The workhorse CTA across the entire site, rendered in deep purple #300064 with white text and full pill rounding ({rounded.full}). On hover, the background shifts to the lighter secondary purple #7a60ff, providing clear feedback without breaking brand identity. The disabled state uses #6f55f5 at 50% opacity, ensuring users can still read the label while understanding the action is unavailable. Padding of 14px 28px and a 48px height give it a substantial, tappable feel on both desktop and mobile.

**`button-secondary`** — An outlined variant with a white background and purple text, used for secondary actions like "Learn More" or "Add to Cart" alongside a primary CTA. The border is 2px solid {colors.primary}, and on hover the background fills with {colors.surface-soft} (#f2edff) while the text remains purple. Same pill rounding and height as the primary button for visual consistency.

**`button-accent-pink`** and **`button-accent-mint`** — Playful accent buttons reserved for promotional banners, limited-time offers, and seasonal campaigns. The pink variant uses #ff6dff with dark text (#1f1f1f), while the mint uses #00fc87. These are the brand's "fun" buttons — same pill shape and size as primary, but the high-saturation pastels signal urgency or delight rather than standard action.

### Cards

**`product-card`** — A white card with soft rounded corners ({rounded.lg}) and a subtle shadow (0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)). The product image sits at the top with matching corner rounding, followed by the product title in {typography.title-md}, a price in {typography.body-md}, and a "Subscribe & Save" badge or standard CTA. On hover, the shadow deepens slightly (0 4px 16px rgba(0,0,0,0.12)) and the card lifts 2px.

**`badge-sale`**, **`badge-new`**, **`badge-bestseller`** — Small pill-shaped badges that overlay product cards or hero imagery. Each uses a distinct accent color from the brand palette: marigold (#fffe64) for sale, mint (#00fc87) for new arrivals, and pink (#ff6dff) for bestsellers. All badges use {typography.badge} (11px uppercase bold) with 4px 10px padding and full rounding.

### Navigation

**`nav-bar`** — A fixed top navigation bar at 72px height, white background with a subtle bottom border ({colors.hairline-soft}). The logo sits on the left (typically the Hello Bello wordmark in purple), with category links (Diapers, Wipes, Bath, etc.) in the center using {typography.nav-link}. The right side contains a search icon, account link, and cart icon. On scroll, the bar gains a slight shadow (0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.06)).

### Forms

**`text-input`** — Standard form input with a white background, 1px solid {colors.hairline} border, and {rounded.sm} corners. On focus, the border shifts to {colors.primary} with a 2px stroke and a subtle purple box-shadow (0 0 0 3px rgba(48,0,100,0.15)). The placeholder text uses {colors.muted-soft}. Error states use a red border (#eb644f) with an error message in {typography.caption}.

### Footer

**`footer-link`** — Text links in the footer area, rendered in {colors.muted} (#6b7280) with {typography.link}. On hover, the color shifts to {colors.primary} (#300064). The footer itself has a light lavender background ({colors.surface-soft}) with sections for customer service, shop by category, and social links. A copyright line sits at the bottom in {typography.caption} with {colors.muted-soft}.

## Responsive Behavior

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile | < 744px | Single-column layout; nav collapses to hamburger menu; product cards stack vertically; hero text reduces to {typography.display-lg}; buttons go full-width; search bar moves to a slide-out panel |
| Tablet | 744–1128px | Two-column product grid; nav shows category links as text only (no icons); hero uses {typography.display-xl} but with tighter padding; badges remain readable |
| Desktop | 1128–1440px | Full three-column product grid; nav shows all links with optional dropdowns; hero uses full {typography.display-xl} with generous padding; search bar visible in nav |
| Wide | > 1440px | Max-width container at 1440px; content centered; hero may use wider imagery; product grid can expand to four columns for certain categories |

### Touch Targets
- All buttons and interactive elements maintain a minimum 44px height (48px preferred) to meet WCAG touch target guidelines
- Nav links have 48px tap areas even when text is smaller
- Product card CTAs are at least 44px tall
- Badges are 24px+ tall for readability

### Collapsing Strategy
- On mobile (< 744px), the top nav collapses to a hamburger menu with a slide-out drawer
- Product category filters collapse to a "Filter" button that opens a modal overlay
- Footer columns stack vertically on mobile, with accordion-style expandable sections
- Hero imagery may crop or stack text below image on small screens
- Search bar transitions from inline to a full-screen overlay on mobile

## Known Gaps

- Hover and active states for many components (badges, footer links, product card CTAs) could not be reliably extracted from the static HTML/CSS analysis
- Error state styling for forms (red borders, error message typography) is inferred from common patterns rather than extracted
- The exact font weight for Alexandria at display sizes is uncertain — the extracted CSS showed multiple weights but the specific mapping to each token is inferred
- Dark mode is not present on the live site and no dark-mode palette could be extracted
- The checkout flow uses Shopify's default styling (#0056a1 blue) which may not match the brand's own design system
- Sub-brand or seasonal palettes (e.g., holiday collections, limited-edition diapers) could not be extracted
- Animation and transition timings (hover lift, shadow changes, menu slide) are estimated based on common e-commerce patterns
- The exact spacing scale for section padding and card margins is inferred from layout analysis rather than extracted CSS variables
- Social media icon colors and payment method badge colors were filtered out but may have brand-specific styling not captured
