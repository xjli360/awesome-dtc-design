description: A brand that builds its entire visual identity around a single, unmistakable voltage: #d54300 — a burnt-orange that reads as anodized aluminum, trail-dust, and the last light on a granite face. This orange is the brand's only color; it appears on the primary CTA, the shopping-bag icon, the "Add to Cart" button, and nowhere else in the palette. The rest of the system is a study in grays and near-grays: #171717 for ink, #676986 for body text, #f4f4f6 for the canvas, and #272d45 for deep-surface accents. The result is a site that feels like a machined part — every element has a purpose, every corner is either perfectly sharp ({rounded.none}) or softly radiused ({rounded.sm} at 8px), and the typography runs Geogrotesque W01 at moderate weights (400–600) with no display-size hero text. The product grid uses 12px rounded corners on cards, a 1px hairline in #e5e5e5, and generous whitespace that lets the gear's own photography — Dyneema composite fabrics, titanium stakes, carbon-fiber poles — carry the emotional weight. There is no decorative illustration, no gradient, no secondary accent color. The brand trusts that the orange, the gray scale, and the product itself are enough.

## Components

### Buttons
**`button-primary`** — The single brand voltage. A solid #d54300 rectangle with 8px rounded corners, white uppercase Geogrotesque at 14px/600. On hover, shifts to #c63e00. Disabled state fades to #eeb499. Used for "Add to Cart," "Checkout," and primary purchase flows. Height is 44px with 12px/24px padding.

**`button-secondary`** — White canvas with a 1px #e5e5e5 border, same uppercase typography. Used for "Learn More," "View Details," and secondary actions. Hover state darkens the border to #d3d4dd.

**`button-tertiary`** — Ghost button with no background, text in #d54300. Used for "Clear Filters," "Cancel," and inline actions. Hover adds a subtle underline.

**`button-pill-urgent`** — A fully rounded pill in #ff4d1a, smaller 12px uppercase type, 32px height. Reserved for limited-time sale badges, "Last Chance" prompts, and urgency signals.

### Cards
**`product-card`** — A white card with 12px rounded corners and a 1px #f4f4f6 border. Contains a product image (top corners rounded, bottom corners sharp), title in 16px/500, price in 16px/600, and optional badge. Hover state thickens the border to #e5e5e5. No shadow — the brand trusts the product photography.

**`product-card-badge`** — A small 11px uppercase label in #28657e (teal) for "NEW" or #6d7d42 (olive) for "SALE," with 4px rounded corners and 2px/8px padding. Sits at the top-left of the card image.

### Navigation
**`nav-bar`** — A 64px white bar with a 1px #f4f4f6 bottom border. Links are 14px/500 Geogrotesque with 0.3px letter spacing. Active and hover states turn the link text to #d54300. The logo sits left, the cart icon (also #d54300) sits right.

**`breadcrumb`** — 13px/500 caption type in #9a9db1, with the active segment in #171717. Separator is a simple "/" in #d3d4dd.

### Forms
**`text-input`** — White background, 1px #e5e5e5 border, 8px rounded corners, 48px height, 16px body type. Active state switches the border to #d54300. Error state switches to #ff4d1a. Used for search, email signup, and checkout fields.

**`quantity-selector`** — A compact 44px input with 8px rounded corners and a 1px #e5e5e5 border. Contains a minus button, the quantity number, and a plus button. The buttons are 40px icon-button circles with hover background.

### Search
**`search-bar`** — A fully rounded pill, 44px tall, with a 1px #e5e5e5 border and 10px/20px padding. Active state switches the border to #d54300. The search icon sits inside the left padding in #9a9db1.

### Filters
**`filter-chip`** — A 36px pill with 1px #e5e5e5 border, 6px/16px padding, and 14px body type. Active state fills with #d54300 and white text. Used in category and size filter strips.

### Footer
**`footer-section`** — A deep #272d45 background with white text. Links are 14px/400 in #d3d4dd, hover to white. The section uses 64px vertical padding and 24px horizontal padding. Contains columns for "Shop," "Support," "About," and "Connect."

## Responsive Behavior

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile | < 744px | Nav collapses to hamburger; product grid goes 1 column; hero padding reduces to 32px; filter chips stack vertically; footer columns stack to 2-column grid |
| Tablet | 744–1128px | Nav shows full links; product grid goes 2 columns; search bar in nav becomes icon-only; footer columns go 2x2 |
| Desktop | 1128–1440px | Full nav with search bar; product grid goes 3 columns; hero uses 64px padding; footer columns go 4 across |
| Wide | > 1440px | Max-width container at 1440px; product grid goes 4 columns; hero uses 80px padding |

### Touch Targets
- All buttons and interactive elements are minimum 44px height (WCAG 2.1 compliant).
- Filter chips are 36px height — acceptable for touch but may feel small; consider 40px on mobile.
- Icon buttons are 40px circles — meets the 44px target for touch.
- Search bar is 44px tall — comfortable for thumb reach.
- Product card links are the full card area (not just the title text).

### Collapsing Strategy
- On mobile, the top nav collapses to a hamburger menu with a slide-out drawer.
- The product filter sidebar (desktop) collapses to a horizontal chip strip on tablet, and to a "Filter" button that opens a modal on mobile.
- The hero section's secondary text collapses on mobile (only headline and primary CTA remain).
- The footer's 4-column layout collapses to 2 columns on tablet, 1 column on mobile.
- Product image galleries (desktop: thumbnail strip + main image) collapse to a single swipeable carousel on mobile.

## Known Gaps

- The extracted hex list includes several colors (#2c3e50, #28657e, #1f4f62, #3e6f8f, #6d7d42, #ff4d1a) that may be Shopify checkout widgets, social icons, or stock-image tones — not confirmed as brand colors. The badge colors (#28657e, #6d7d42) are best guesses from the list.
- Font weights beyond 400, 500, and 600 are assumed — the extracted CSS only showed "inherit" and generic sans-serif. Geogrotesque W01 may have 700 available but it's not confirmed on the live site.
- Hover states for buttons and links are inferred from common patterns (darken primary, underline text) — not extracted from live CSS.
- Error styling for forms (error messages, validation icons) is not present in the extracted data.
- Dark mode is not supported on the live site (no `prefers-color-scheme` detected).
- The "Outage" and "Outage Cut" fonts in the extracted list appear to be decorative/display fonts used sparingly (possibly for the logo or hero headlines) — not included in the typography system as they are not the primary reading face.
- The `oke-widget-icons` font is from Okendo (reviews platform) — not a brand font.
- No animation or transition timings were extracted (assume 200ms ease for hover/focus transitions).
- The extracted hex list is large (20+ colors) and likely includes many non-brand colors from third-party widgets and images. The true brand palette is probably the 6-8 most frequent grays + the distinctive orange.
