description: At rest, HyperShop's interface is nearly indistinguishable from the dark glass face of the devices it powers — the canvas sits at #121212, barely eighteen lux above true black, while product surfaces layer upward through #171717 and #1f1f1f in increments that read as material depth rather than color contrast. The lone departure from this monochrome compression is #dedede, a cool silver-gray that carries all readable text and every primary interactive signal; it is not white — its slight desaturation avoids the clinical glare of #ffffff and recalls the brushed aluminum chassis of the HyperDrive docks and HyperJuice battery packs the store sells. This single non-black value does the work of a full accent palette: it fills primary buttons, anchors product names on dark cards, and marks active category tabs, because contrast alone is strong enough against the near-black stack below. Typography runs through a proprietary font family — myFontLight, myFontRegular, myFontMedium, myFontBold — with Inter as the system fallback, a stack that signals custom brand investment while keeping OS rendering crisp at small sizes. The four named weights let a single typeface handle the range from 11px all-caps specification labels set in myFontMedium with 1.2px tracking, to 48px hero headlines in myFontBold, without importing a display face or a contrasting serif. Rounded corners hold at {rounded.xs} and {rounded.sm} throughout — 4px and 8px respectively — a range that reads as precisely machined rather than friendly or organic; there are no pill shapes or full radii in the core UI. The overall effect is a storefront that behaves like a settings screen from the device's own operating system: monochromatic, deliberate, and confident that the hardware will provide the color.

## Components

### Buttons

**`button-primary`** — Light-on-dark filled button using #dedede as the fill and #121212 as the label color, creating an inverted-display effect that reads as active rather than washed out against the dark canvas. Active state steps up to full #ffffff fill; disabled state drops to the #404040 background with muted text at {colors.muted}, keeping the element spatially present without affording interaction. Corners hold at {rounded.xs} (4px) — matching the machined-edge aesthetic of the hardware product category.

**`button-secondary`** — Transparent background with a 1px {colors.hairline} border and {colors.ink} text at rest. Hover state fills with {colors.surface-card} and sharpens the border to 1px {colors.primary}, creating subtle depth. Used for secondary actions like "Compare," "Learn More," or modal dismissal alongside primary add-to-cart flows.

**`button-ghost`** — Borderless, transparent, {colors.ink} text at {typography.button-sm}. Appears for in-context navigation-style actions within spec tables, accordion bodies, and inline "See all" links.

### Search

**`search-bar`** — A 44px-tall input variant on {colors.surface-card} with a 1px {colors.hairline} border and {rounded.xs} corners. Search icon sits at {colors.muted} at rest, sharpening to {colors.ink} on first keystroke. Results surface as a {colors.surface-card} dropdown below the bar with per-result product thumbnails and names in {typography.title-sm}.

### Navigation

**`nav-bar`** — 64px bar in {colors.surface-soft} (#171717) separated from the page by a 1px {colors.hairline} bottom border. Category links render in {typography.nav-link}; the logo in {typography.logo-display} colored {colors.primary-active} (white). Active category receives a 2px {colors.primary} underline via the `category-tab-active` spec; inactive categories use {colors.muted} text and a transparent underline, making the tab selection read as a state rather than a selection widget.

### Product Card

**`product-card`** — Sits on {colors.surface-card} (#1f1f1f) with {rounded.sm} corners and a transparent border at rest that upgrades to 1px {colors.hairline} on hover. Product images display at 1:1 aspect ratio with `contain` fit — required for the varied form factors of docks, cable adapters, and battery packs, which cannot be safely cropped. Name in {typography.title-sm}, price in {typography.price} at {colors.primary}.

### Hero

**`hero`** — Full-width section on raw {colors.canvas} (#121212) with left-aligned text layout. The headline renders in {typography.display-xl} at {colors.primary-active} (white) for maximum contrast; the subheadline in {typography.display-sm} at {colors.body} for tonal separation. The primary CTA uses the `hero-cta` spec with 32px horizontal padding. On mobile, type scale steps down one level and the layout becomes center-aligned with the product image repositioned below the text block.

### Spec Table

**`spec-table`** — A two-column key-value layout used extensively on product detail pages for port counts, wattage ratings, and compatibility lists. Labels set in {typography.spec-label} (11px, uppercase, 1.2px tracking) at {colors.muted}; values in {typography.body-sm} at {colors.body}. Rows are separated by 1px {colors.hairline} dividers with 12px vertical padding each. The table renders directly on {colors.canvas} without any surface elevation — it reads as editorial content rather than a UI component.

### Product Image Viewer

**`product-image-viewer`** — Main image in a {colors.surface-card} panel with {rounded.sm} corners. A thumbnail strip (64px tiles, {spacing.sm} gaps) sits below; the active thumbnail receives a 2px {colors.primary} border while inactive ones hold a 2px {colors.hairline} border. The {colors.surface-card} background is load-bearing: product images often have transparency and need a non-black backing to avoid merging with the canvas.

### Badges

**`badge-new`** — A 4px-rounded label on {colors.primary} fill with {colors.on-primary} text in {typography.caption}. Appears in the top-left corner of product card images for recently released SKUs. **`badge-sale`** — Identical geometry on {colors.sale-red} fill (#c0392b) for discounted items.

### Tooltip

**`tooltip`** — Appears on hover over spec icons and "?" labels in product configurator rows. Rendered on {colors.surface-card} with a 1px {colors.hairline} border, {rounded.xs} corners, {typography.caption} text at {colors.body}, and a 240px max-width to keep spec copy readable.

### Footer

**`footer`** — Full-width on {colors.canvas} with a 1px {colors.hairline} top border and {spacing.xxl} vertical padding. Section headings in {typography.title-sm} at {colors.primary}; link text in {typography.body-sm} at {colors.ink}; legal and copyright copy in {colors.muted}. Renders as a four-column grid on desktop, collapses to stacked accordions on mobile with tappable heading toggles.

## Responsive Behavior

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile | < 744px | Single-column product grid; nav collapses to hamburger with drawer; hero text centers and product image moves below copy; spec table scrolls horizontally; footer collapses to accordions |
| Tablet | 744–1128px | Two-column product grid; nav shows logo and search bar with hamburger for categories; hero retains left alignment; footer shifts to two-column grid |
| Desktop | 1128–1440px | Three-column product grid; full nav with all category links and search visible; hero gains side-by-side image layout; spec table full-width two-column |
| Wide | > 1440px | Content constrained to 1440px max-width and centered; four-column product grid; hero background extends edge-to-edge behind the content container |

### Touch Targets

- All interactive elements minimum 44×44px tap region regardless of visual size
- Nav hamburger icon: 44×44px tap zone with {spacing.sm} internal padding
- Product card: entire card surface is tappable, not just the name or image region
- Image viewer thumbnails: minimum 44px tap zone even when rendered at 64px visual size
- Add to Cart / Buy Now: full-width on mobile (100% minus {spacing.lg} side margins)
- Category tab strip: individual tabs min 44px height; strip scrolls horizontally on mobile

### Collapsing Strategy

- Footer links collapse to tap-to-expand accordions at < 744px; section headings remain visible as toggles
- Category nav folds to a horizontal scroll strip on tablet and into a hamburger drawer on mobile
- Spec tables reflow to stacked card rows (label above value) on mobile to avoid horizontal overflow
- Hero two-column layout (text + image) collapses to stacked single-column on mobile, image second
- Image viewer thumbnail strip switches from a vertical left-rail (desktop optional) to a horizontal scroll row on mobile and tablet
- Search bar moves from inline in the nav to a full-width bar below the logo row on mobile

## Known Gaps

- No brand accent color detected — HyperShop likely uses a highlight color (possibly cyan, electric blue, or orange) loaded via JavaScript or injected through a theme asset; all interactive accent and badge colors in this spec are approximated from the extracted near-black and silver-gray palette
- Only four hex values extracted (#171717, #1f1f1f, #dedede, #121212); muted, hairline, body, and all derived intermediate tones are reasoned interpolations between the extracted endpoints, not confirmed computed values
- Badge sale color (#c0392b) is a conventional alert red derived from general UI practice, not extracted from the site
- Custom font family "myFont" (myFontBold, myFontLight, myFontMedium, myFontRegular) is present in the CSS font-family stack but the foundry name, actual weight integers, and license terms are unconfirmed; Inter is the specified fallback
- Exact font sizes, line heights, and letter-spacing values for the proprietary myFont family are not extractable from static hints and are inferred from category conventions
- Logo treatment (wordmark, monogram, or icon lockup) not determinable from extraction
- Dark/light mode toggle presence unknown — the #171717 theme-color meta tag signals dark-mode-first, but a light theme may exist
- Hover animation durations and easing curves not extractable from static page hints
- Cart drawer, checkout flow, and account page component patterns not captured
