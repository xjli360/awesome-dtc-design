description: Fourteen product colorways — lime (#9fcc4b), chartreuse (#ceea37), hot pink (#e71f7b), coral (#fda262), sky blue (#bfecf5), and nine more — stacked on a near-black (#1c1c1c) and pale ash (#eaebef) structural grid is Incase's sharpest design statement: the protective gear IS the color story. The brand sells precision-fit laptop bags and cases, and its UI treats those colorways as first-class content — large circular swatches, high-saturation product photography on bare white tiles, and a deliberately quiet typographic voice in plain Arial so nothing competes with the objects themselves. The primary CTA voltage is a bold orange-red (#ff5a2b), used sparingly on add-to-cart buttons and promotional highlights; its warmth signals action without clashing against any of the product hues in the catalog. The structural palette is tripartite: near-black (#1c1c1c) for headings and navigation, steel blue-gray (#7e838c) for secondary text and metadata, and ash (#eaebef) as the ambient page fill. Navy (#233246) and medium steel (#40799d) surface in collection banners and layered UI panels, providing depth without resorting to pure black wallpaper. Cards are sharp — {rounded.none} to {rounded.xs} — consistent with a brand that values engineered precision over softened consumer appeal. Navigation is wide and flat, exposing the full product taxonomy through a mega-menu that opens with category headings in tight uppercase Arial. Spacing is deliberate: product grids breathe at {spacing.xxl} column gaps, hero modules occupy full-viewport frames, and section separators fall at {spacing.section}. The overall effect is a storefront that presents like a clean-room specification sheet — exact, stripped, entirely confident that the products require no ornamental framing to earn attention.

## Components

### Buttons

**`button-primary`** — Sharp-cornered ({rounded.none}) rectangle in #ff5a2b with white uppercase Arial at 14px/700 and 0.5px tracking. The zero-radius treatment keeps the orange-red CTA visually flush with the grid and product photography edges. Active state drops to #e03e12; disabled fades to a desaturated coral (#f9bfac) while preserving the uppercase label and correct height.

**`button-secondary`** — Transparent fill with a 2px #1c1c1c outline, same sharp corner, same uppercase label treatment. Appears alongside the primary on PDPs for secondary actions ("Add to Wishlist," "Find in Store"). On dark backgrounds it inverts: white outline, white label.

**`button-ghost`** — Text-only label in #7e838c, no border, no background. Handles low-hierarchy actions — filter resets, "View All" links, pagination controls — without adding visual weight to the page.

### Text Input

**`text-input`** — Thin 1px #eaebef border at rest, transitions to 1px #1c1c1c on focus. No border-radius; fully rectangular. Placeholder in #7e838c at 14px/400. Used in search, newsletter subscribe forms, and all checkout fields.

### Navigation

**`nav-bar`** — 60px white bar with a 1px #eaebef bottom border. Logo sits left; top-level category links in 13px/500 Arial span the center; search, account, and cart icons cluster right. On scroll the bar gains a soft box-shadow rather than changing color, preserving the white canvas identity.

**`nav-mega-menu`** — Full-width dropdown panel below the nav bar, white background, with department headings in 11px tracked uppercase (#1c1c1c or #233246) and product-type links beneath in standard 13px. Columns are separated by whitespace only — no vertical rules. An editorial product image or campaign banner may occupy a right-side panel for featured collections.

### Product Card

**`product-card`** — Square image tile on a #eaebef background, zero radius, with the product name in 14px/700, a color swatch row below, and price in 16px/700. On hover a 1px #c1cac5 border traces the card edge and a subtle 4px shadow lifts it. Color swatches ({color-swatch}) render as 20px circles — up to six visible, overflow collapsed to a "+N" caption in 12px muted gray.

### Hero

**`hero-module`** — Full-bleed #0a0a0a section with a white 40px/700 headline, 16px/400 body copy, and an #ff5a2b primary CTA. On desktop, lifestyle photography bleeds to the right half while text anchors the left 50%. Minimum height is 580px; vertical padding enforces {spacing.section} so the headline never crowds the nav bar or CTA.

**`hero-split`** — Two-column split: a left #eaebef ash panel with a 28px/700 headline and short descriptor, and a right white panel showing an isolated product. Used on category intros and campaign landing pages. Both panels carry {spacing.xxl} internal padding; no dividing border.

### Collection Banner

**`collection-banner`** — Full-width #233246 navy strip with white 28px/700 heading, used as the page header for collection and category listing pages. Image-free — relies on the navy-white contrast for visual authority. Swaps to #ff5a2b background for sale or limited-run events.

### Badges

**`badge-new`** — 4px-radius #ff5a2b chip with 10px uppercase white label at 0.8px tracking, 3×8px padding. Placed top-left corner of product card imagery. Used for new arrivals and recent additions.

**`badge-sale`** — Near-black (#0a0a0a) variant of the same chip geometry, deployed when a product has a markdown price. Label reads "SALE" or the discount percentage.

**`badge-colorway`** — Ash (#eaebef) chip with #7e838c label, used to indicate color counts or limited availability — e.g., "3 Colors" — beneath the product title on cards with no visible swatch strip.

### Color Swatches

**`color-swatch`** — 20px circular chips with a 2px transparent border on rest; the active swatch gains a 2px #1c1c1c ring with an inset gap so the actual color reads clearly. The product palette spans fourteen hues from lime (#9fcc4b) to crimson (#97293c) to sky (#bfecf5), making these chips the primary color-communication layer before photography loads. On mobile, the row is horizontally scrollable if more than four swatches are present.

### Search

**`search-drawer`** — A drop-down bar that replaces the top portion of the page below the nav bar, autofocusing a text-input. Suggestions populate as a flat list — product names, categories, and popular searches — below the input field. No modal overlay; the page dims behind a translucent scrim layer.

### Cart Drawer

**`cart-drawer`** — Right-side slide-in panel with a 1px #eaebef left border. Header "Your Cart" in 16px/700; line items show product thumbnail, name in 14px/400, selected color in 12px muted caption, and price in 16px/700. Subtotal row and primary CTA ("Checkout") pin to the drawer bottom with a 1px #eaebef top border separating them from the items list.

### Product Image Rail

**`product-image-rail`** — Vertical strip of small thumbnails on the left side of the PDP image viewer on desktop. Each thumbnail sits on an #eaebef background; the active thumbnail is outlined in a 1px #1c1c1c border. No border-radius on any tile. Thumbnails are spaced at {spacing.sm} intervals.

### Footer

**`footer`** — Near-black (#0a0a0a) full-width block with four link columns. Column headings in 12px/700 uppercase tracked; links in 14px/400 at #a3a4a8 brightening to white on hover. A thinner sub-footer strip below carries social icons, copyright, and legal links in 12px caption gray.

## Responsive Behavior

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile | < 744px | Single-column product grid; nav collapses to hamburger plus icon tray; hero-module stacks text above image full-width; hero-split becomes single column with image on top; color-swatch row truncates at 4 chips with "+N" overflow |
| Tablet | 744–1128px | Two-column product grid; nav-mega-menu becomes full-screen overlay accordion; hero-module maintains side-by-side at reduced headline (display-md 28px); cart-drawer slides up full-width from the bottom |
| Desktop | 1128–1440px | Three- or four-column product grid; full nav-bar and mega-menu panel; hero-module at 580px minimum height; cart-drawer as a 400px fixed right panel |
| Wide | > 1440px | Content capped at 1440px with auto horizontal margins; product grid may expand to five columns; hero photography extends edge-to-edge behind a max-width text container |

### Touch Targets

- Nav icons (search, account, cart) and hamburger: minimum 44×44px tap zone regardless of visual size
- Color swatches: 20px visual chip wrapped in a 36px minimum touch area
- Product card: full card surface including image tile is the tap region
- All primary and secondary CTAs: fixed 48px height

### Collapsing Strategy

- Primary nav collapses to hamburger at < 744px; mega-menu categories become stacked accordion sections inside a full-height slide-in drawer
- Footer columns collapse to a single accordion list on mobile; column headings become toggle triggers
- Product image rail switches from a vertical left column to a horizontal scrolling thumbnail strip beneath the main image on mobile and tablet
- Search triggers a full-width takeover bar that slides down over the nav content on mobile, rather than dropping below

## Known Gaps

- No custom web font detected; Arial/Helvetica stacks are system defaults — Incase may load a proprietary or licensed typeface via Shopify theme JS that was not captured during extraction
- Meta theme-color is absent; the true mobile browser chrome color cannot be confirmed from extraction
- Button and card border-radius values are inferred from brand aesthetic ({rounded.none}) rather than measured from rendered CSS
- Hover/focus transition durations and easing curves are not available from extraction
- The fourteen product colorways are present in the hex palette but their exact names and SKU-to-hex mappings (e.g., which hex is "Desert Camo" vs. "Cobalt") are unknown
- Dark-mode or alternate seasonal theme presence could not be verified
- The icon system (SVG sprite, icon font, or custom glyph set) used throughout nav, cart, and PDP is unidentified
- Exact mega-menu column counts and featured-panel image dimensions are unconfirmed
