name: Infantino
description: ArcherPro Medium — a slab serif that normally lives in magazine mastheads and editorial contexts — shows up as Infantino's foundational typeface, an unusual choice for a baby product brand and the source of its warmest quality. The site's palette hinges on a vivid red-orange (#e94125) as the single high-voltage CTA color, paired with two closely tuned teals that serve separate semantic roles: #4dacaa handles category accents, badge fills, and hover surfaces, while #00afab — perceptibly deeper — takes interactive focus states and link emphasis. A warm brown-tan (#7c6a55) functions as the tertiary: earthier than a neutral gray, it anchors lifestyle photography, secondary labels, and the occasional price-adjacent supporting text without announcing itself. Pathout Italic appears at display scale only — hero banners and seasonal campaign headers — where its looping forms supply the playful contrast that ArcherPro's upright slab character cannot.

  Rounded geometry signals the brand's approachable, child-safe posture throughout: primary CTAs run pill-shaped ({rounded.full}), product cards use {rounded.md} at their corners, and rectangular sale flags snap to {rounded.xs}. No hard 90-degree angles appear in marketing zones. The background leans toward a warm off-white — #f2f2f2 surfaces behind product grids, #e5e5e5 as hairlines — keeping photography luminous rather than clinical. At 16px with a 1.5 line-height, body text holds legibility for parents parsing ingredient lists and age-safety specs on phones during nighttime feeds; the type scale prioritizes reading conditions over aesthetic sparseness.

  On the Shopify storefront, the red-orange primary drives every add-to-cart and checkout CTA, while the teal secondary differentiates category navigation and informational callouts — effectively replacing Shopify's generic navy with a brand-owned color system. Gift-set and bundle pages draw on {colors.accent-warm} to communicate value without price-cut language, leaning into a quality-led retail register. The overall visual system reads bright but not garish: one signal color, one category color, one warmth color, held together by a slab serif that most competitors in the baby aisle would never reach for.

## Components

### Buttons
**`button-primary`** — The primary CTA runs red-orange (#e94125) on a pill shape ({rounded.full}), 48px tall with 28px horizontal padding. On press, the surface deepens to {colors.primary-active} (#c83018); the disabled state fades to {colors.primary-disabled} and removes pointer events. This is the exclusive color for add-to-cart and Shopify checkout entries — nothing else on the page uses red-orange fills.

**`button-secondary`** — Teal-filled at {colors.secondary} (#4dacaa), also pill-shaped. Active state advances to {colors.secondary-active} (#00afab). Used for category navigation CTAs, gift-finder entries, and "Learn More" actions that don't trigger the purchase flow.

**`button-ghost`** — Transparent fill with a 2px red-orange border and matching label text at {typography.button-md}. Appears alongside `button-primary` in two-CTA hero layouts and gift-set pages where both options carry equal weight.

### Navigation
**`nav-bar`** — 64px tall white bar with a 1px {colors.hairline} bottom border. Type is {typography.nav-link} at 14px/500. Active category links shift to {colors.primary} text with no underline or underline animation. On mobile the bar reduces to logo-center and hamburger-right; a full-height drawer carries the category list with accordion subcategories.

### Product Cards
**`product-card`** — White ({colors.surface-card}) card with {rounded.md} corners and a soft 8px shadow at low opacity. Title in {typography.title-md}, price in {typography.price} red-orange. A `product-card-badge` at {rounded.xs} overlays the top-left corner for "New", "Sale", or "Bundle" flags in red-orange on white label text.

### Hero
**`hero-banner`** — Full-width section on {colors.surface-soft} warm-gray background, minimum 560px tall. Seasonal campaigns use {typography.display-hero} (Pathout Italic at 64px) for the main headline; evergreen product categories fall back to {typography.display-xl} (ArcherPro Medium at 48px). Body copy runs {typography.body-md}. CTA row pairs `button-primary` and `button-ghost` side by side.

### Age & Category Badges
**`age-badge`** — Teal pill ({colors.secondary}, {rounded.full}) with all-caps label tracking at 1px letter-spacing. Displays "0–3M", "6+ Months", "1 Year+" on product cards, detail pages, and filter panels to communicate developmental suitability at a glance.

**`category-chip`** — Off-white pill with {colors.hairline} border at rest; advances to a solid {colors.secondary} fill on selection with no border. Used in the horizontal filter strip above product grids. On mobile the strip is a full-bleed scrollable row with no wrapping.

### Promo Banner
**`promo-banner`** — 36px red-orange bar sitting above the nav, full viewport width. Short promotional copy in {typography.caption} white text, centered. On viewports under 375px the text truncates with a marquee scroll or collapses to an icon-only dismiss control.

### Safety Callout
**`safety-callout`** — {colors.surface-soft} box with a 1px {colors.hairline} border, {rounded.md} corners, and a {colors.secondary-active} icon on the left margin. Appears on product detail pages for age-safety disclosures, material composition, and choking-hazard warnings. Body copy in {typography.body-sm} ensures legibility at small viewport widths.

### Award Badge
**`award-badge`** — Warm brown ({colors.accent-warm}) badge with white text at {typography.badge} scale and {rounded.sm} corners. Communicates industry awards or "Bestseller" status without borrowing the red-orange primary, keeping {colors.primary} reserved exclusively for purchase actions.

### Search
**`search-bar`** — Pill-shaped ({rounded.full}) {colors.surface-soft} input with a 1px {colors.hairline} border, 44px height, and a magnifier icon in {colors.muted} on the left interior. On focus, the border advances to {colors.secondary}, mirroring the `text-input-focus` state and connecting search to the teal category system.

### Footer
**`footer`** — Charcoal ({colors.ink}) background with white body copy ({typography.body-sm}) and {colors.secondary} teal links for section headings and external destinations. Four-column grid on desktop with 48px top-and-bottom padding; collapses to accordion sections with toggle controls on mobile.

## Responsive Behavior

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile | < 744px | Single-column product grid; nav collapses to hamburger drawer; hero-banner stacks text above image; promo-banner truncates or marquees; button-primary goes full-width; category-chip strip scrolls horizontally |
| Tablet | 744–1128px | Two-column product grid; nav shows primary categories with overflow in dropdown; hero-banner switches to side-by-side layout at reduced padding |
| Desktop | 1128–1440px | Three-column product grid; full five-category nav-bar; hero-banner at full 560px min-height; promo-banner displays complete message |
| Wide | > 1440px | Grid and content cap at 1440px max-width with auto lateral margins; hero-banner background color bleeds full-width while content constrains to grid |

### Touch Targets
- Minimum 44px height on all interactive elements — buttons, chips, inputs, and nav links
- Age-badge and category-chip tap areas extended with 12px vertical padding on mobile
- Hamburger nav target is 48×48px with a 12px internal icon
- Product card entire surface is tappable; not limited to the title or image alone

### Collapsing Strategy
- Nav secondary links (Gift Finder, Sale, Blog) collapse into hamburger before primary category items
- Hero dual-CTA row stacks vertically on mobile with button-primary on top
- Safety callout icon collapses on viewports under 375px; text-only version at {typography.body-sm} persists
- Footer four-column grid collapses to stacked accordion sections with plus/minus toggles
- Award badge and age-badge remain visible on product cards at all breakpoints; promo-banner is the first element hidden on print stylesheets

## Known Gaps

- Only "ArcherPro Medium" was extracted; regular-weight (400) body copy may require a separately loaded ArcherPro Regular cut not confirmed in extraction — body-md fontWeight: 400 is an inference
- Pathout Italic line-height, exact scale breakpoints, and letterspacing not extractable from live site; values estimated from visual cadence
- Exact button height and horizontal padding not confirmed via computed styles — 48px height and 28px padding derived from visual proportion against the reference format
- primary-active (#c83018) and primary-disabled (#f5b3a5) are derived tints/shades; not confirmed via source inspection
- No dark-mode token set visible in extraction — site appears light-only on the current Shopify theme build
- Shadow values for product-card not extracted; 0 2px 8px rgba approximation estimated from visual card lift
- Disabled and hover states for button-secondary and button-ghost not confirmed; only button-primary states are estimated with confidence
- Hover transition durations and easing functions not extracted; 150ms ease assumed throughout
- Meta theme-color is unset, suggesting no PWA or app-clip manifest on current build
- Semantic split between #4dacaa (category/badge) and #00afab (interactive/focus) is inferred from visual hierarchy, not confirmed via source inspection
- Exact nav-bar height not confirmed; 64px estimated from proportional inspection
