description: A running brand that paints its gear in the colors of the places it comes from — #108474 (a deep teal pulled from Costa Rican jungle canopy) and #c8c6c5 (a weathered stone gray) set the tone, while accents like #ea3d26 (volcanic red) and #f6f1a0 (high-altitude yellow) flash across product details and CTAs. The palette reads like a field notebook: #90a7a3 (mossy sage), #899379 (dry earth), #485354 (basalt), and #b45457 (clay brick) appear in patterns and linings, not just trim. Typography splits between PierSans-Bold for headlines — a sturdy, slightly condensed sans that stands up to trail grit — and Nunito Sans for body, a rounder, more approachable face that keeps the brand from feeling too severe. Buttons use {rounded.full} pills in that teal or red, while product cards sit in {rounded.sm} on a #f7f7f7 canvas, letting the photography — always of runners in real landscapes, not studios — carry the emotional weight. The nav bar is a thin strip of {colors.ink} (#29292d) with white text, a deliberate inversion that says "we're serious about performance." There's no hero carousel; instead, the homepage leads with a single full-bleed image and a bold PierSans statement, trusting the place and the runner to sell the gear.

## Components

### Buttons
**`button-primary`** — The workhorse CTA, a full-pill in the brand's teal (#108474) with white PierSans-bold text. On hover, it shifts to `primary-active` (#0d6b5d); disabled state uses a washed-out teal (#a3d4c9). Used for "Add to Cart," "Shop Now," and primary checkout flows. **`button-secondary`** — An inverted pill with a white fill and ink (#29292d) text, bordered by a 1px hairline. Hover adds a subtle shadow. **`button-accent-red`** and **`button-accent-yellow`** — High-energy variants for limited drops, sale alerts, or "Explore" CTAs on hero sections. Red uses #ea3d26; yellow uses #f6f1a0 with ink text. **`button-tertiary-text`** — A plain text link styled as a button, used for "Learn More" or "View Details" in content-heavy areas.

### Cards
**`product-card`** — A white card with `{rounded.sm}` corners on a `{colors.canvas}` background. The product image sits flush within the card's `{rounded.sm}`. Title uses `{typography.title-sm}` in ink, price in `{typography.body-md}` in body. A **`product-card-badge`** — a small red pill with uppercase "NEW" or "SALE" — can overlay the top-left of the image. Cards have no border; separation comes from the canvas-to-card contrast.

### Navigation
**`nav-bar`** — A 64px-high strip in `{colors.ink}` (#29292d) with white uppercase nav links (`{typography.nav-link}`). The logo sits left-aligned; links (Men, Women, Accessories, Explore) are center or right. Active link turns `{colors.accent-yellow}`. On mobile, the nav collapses into a hamburger menu with a slide-out drawer.

### Forms
**`text-input`** — A white input field with `{rounded.sm}`, 48px tall, using `{typography.body-md}`. On focus, it gains a 2px teal ring (`{colors.primary}`). Used for email signups, search, and checkout forms. **`search-bar`** — A full-pill variant of the text input, used in the site header or on search results pages.

### Footer
**`footer`** — A dark section in `{colors.ink}` with `{colors.muted-soft}` body text. Links are white (`{colors.canvas}`) and use `{typography.link}`. Section headings use `{typography.title-sm}` in white. The footer includes columns for "Shop," "About," "Support," and social links. A thin `{colors.hairline}` divider separates the top from the bottom copyright row.

### Collection Strip
**`collection-strip`** — A horizontal scrollable row of collection tabs (e.g., "Trail," "Road," "Travel"). Active tabs use `{colors.primary}` fill with white text in a pill shape; inactive tabs use `{colors.surface-soft}` with `{colors.body}` text. Used on collection pages and the homepage to filter by activity.

### Product Detail
**`size-selector`** — A small square or rounded button (40px) for size options. Active state inverts to `{colors.ink}` fill with white text. **`quantity-selector`** — A compact row with minus/plus buttons and a number display, all in `{colors.surface-soft}` with `{rounded.sm}`. **`accordion`** — Used for product descriptions, materials, and shipping info. Each section has a `{typography.title-sm}` header and `{typography.body-sm}` content, separated by a `{colors.hairline}` divider.

## Responsive Behavior

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile | < 744px | Nav collapses to hamburger; product cards go single-column; hero height reduces to 400px; collection strip becomes a vertical accordion; footer stacks into single column |
| Tablet | 744–1128px | Nav links show as text (no icons); product cards in 2-column grid; hero height at 500px; collection strip remains horizontal but scrollable |
| Desktop | 1128–1440px | Full nav with all links; product cards in 3- or 4-column grid; hero at 600px; collection strip shows all tabs without scroll |
| Wide | > 1440px | Max-width container (1440px) centered; hero may use full-bleed; product cards in 4-column grid; additional whitespace on sides |

### Touch Targets
- All buttons and interactive elements: minimum 44px height
- Nav links: 44px tap area (even if text is smaller)
- Size selectors: 40px minimum, with 8px gap between options
- Quantity selector buttons: 44x44px tap area
- Collection tabs: 44px height with 12px horizontal padding

### Collapsing Strategy
- Primary nav collapses to hamburger at < 744px; drawer slides from left
- Product filters collapse to a "Filter" button that opens a modal on mobile
- Footer columns stack vertically on mobile, with accordion-style expand/collapse for each section
- Collection strip tabs collapse to a dropdown or accordion on mobile
- Hero text overlay reduces font size and may stack vertically

## Known Gaps

- Hover states for secondary buttons, text inputs, and nav links could not be reliably extracted from the static CSS; the above uses reasonable defaults (subtle shadow, border color change)
- Error styling for form inputs (red border, error message typography) is not present in the extracted data
- Sub-brand or collection-specific palettes (e.g., "Costa Rica," "Iceland," "Patagonia" collections) may have their own accent colors not captured here
- Dark mode is not implemented on the live site; no dark-mode tokens exist
- The extracted font list includes "JudgemeStar" (a review widget icon font) and "Trirong" (possibly a secondary serif for editorial content) — these are noted but not used in core components
- The extracted hex list is unusually large (30 colors), suggesting many are from product photography, social icons, or Shopify checkout widgets (e.g., #0064a5, #0054a5 are likely Klarna/Afterpay blues; #d81f2d is likely a social icon). The true brand palette is distilled from the most frequent and distinctive non-widget colors
- Animation durations, easing curves, and transition properties are not documented
- Focus-visible styles for keyboard navigation are not extracted
- Print stylesheet behavior is unknown
