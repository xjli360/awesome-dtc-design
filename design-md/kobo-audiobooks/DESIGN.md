name: Kobo Audiobooks
description: A deep red anchor (#bf0000) cuts across a predominantly white and serif-heavy reading experience, marking every primary action — the “Buy Now” button on a book detail page, the progress bar in the reading interface, the active tab in the navigation. This is a brand built for long-form reading, not quick scanning: body copy runs Georgia at 16px with generous leading (1.6), and display headings use Trebuchet MS at 24–32px in weight 600, a choice that reads as earnest and slightly academic rather than trendy. The top navigation is a clean horizontal bar with dropdown menus for “Books”, “eReaders”, “Audiobooks”, and “Blog”, each link set in Trebuchet MS at 14px weight 400 with 12px padding — no pill shapes, no rounded search bars, no decorative icons. Product cards in the grid use a simple white background with a soft shadow, a cover image, and title/author in Georgia body-sm (14px), with the price and a “Add to Cart” button in the brand red. The overall mood is that of a serious bookstore — the red is the only color that breaks the monochrome, and it does so with the confidence of a university press logo. Buttons are rectangular with 4px rounding (`{rounded.xs}`), not pill-shaped; the search bar is a simple input field with a magnifying-glass icon, not a floating orb. The system trusts typography and whitespace over illustration or photography — there are no hero images, no lifestyle shots, only book covers and text.

## Components

### Buttons
**`button-primary`** — The primary call-to-action across the site, used for “Add to Cart”, “Buy Now”, and “Subscribe”. A solid red rectangle with 4px rounding (`{rounded.xs}`) and white text in Trebuchet MS weight 600 at 15px. On hover, the background shifts to `{colors.primary-active}` (#a00000). The disabled state uses `{colors.primary-disabled}` (#f2b3b3) — a pale pinkish-red that still reads as the brand but signals inactivity. Height is 40px, padding 10px 20px.

**`button-secondary`** — A white button with a 1px hairline border (`{colors.hairline}`) and dark text. Used for “Learn More”, “View Details”, and secondary checkout actions. On hover, the background fills with `{colors.surface-soft}` (#f5f5f5). Same 40px height and 4px rounding as the primary, maintaining a consistent button system.

**`button-tertiary-text`** — A text-only link styled as a button, used for “Cancel”, “Remove”, and “Back to Search”. No background, no border, red text (`{colors.primary}`) in Trebuchet MS weight 600. On hover, the text shifts to `{colors.primary-active}`.

### Text Inputs
**`text-input`** — The standard input field for search, login, and checkout forms. White background, 1px hairline border, Georgia body text at 16px, 4px rounding. On focus, the border becomes a 2px solid red (`{colors.primary}`). On error, the same red border appears — the brand uses its single accent color for both focus and error states, relying on helper text to disambiguate. Height 40px, padding 10px 12px.

### Navigation
**`nav-bar`** — A fixed top bar at 56px height, white background with a soft bottom border (`{colors.hairline-soft}`). Contains the Kobo logo (left), a horizontal list of nav links (Books, eReaders, Audiobooks, Blog), a search icon, and a user account dropdown. Nav links are Trebuchet MS at 14px weight 400 with 12px padding. The active page is indicated by a 2px red underline (`{colors.primary}`). Dropdown menus (`{nav-dropdown}`) are white with 4px rounding and 8px vertical padding.

**`breadcrumb`** — A simple text-only breadcrumb trail in caption size (13px Arial) with muted gray color. The current page is rendered in `{colors.ink}`. No arrows or separators — just spaces and the active state.

### Cards
**`product-card`** — A white card with 4px rounding and 12px padding, containing a book cover image (full width), the title in `{title-md}` (18px Trebuchet MS weight 600), the author in `{body-sm}` (14px Georgia, muted gray), and the price in `{button-md}` (15px Trebuchet MS weight 600, ink color). On hover, a subtle box shadow appears (`0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)`). No border, no background color — the card relies on the white canvas and the shadow to lift off the page.

### Badges
**`badge`** — A small uppercase label used for “NEW”, “SALE”, and “BESTSELLER”. Red background (`{colors.primary}`), white text, 11px Trebuchet MS weight 700 with 0.5px letter spacing, 4px rounding, 2px 6px padding. Always positioned at the top-left corner of the product card image.

### Progress Bar
**`progress-bar`** — Used in the reading interface to show book completion. A 4px tall, fully rounded (`{rounded.full}`) track in `{colors.hairline-soft}` with a red fill (`{colors.primary}`) of the same height and rounding. No text, no percentage label — just a visual indicator.

### Tabs
**`tab-active`** — The selected tab in a horizontal tab strip (e.g., “Books”, “Audiobooks”, “eBooks”). Red text (`{colors.primary}`) with a 2px red underline. Nav-link typography (14px Trebuchet MS weight 400). Inactive tabs use `{colors.muted}` with no underline.

## Responsive Behavior

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile | < 744px | Nav bar collapses to hamburger menu; product cards stack in single column; search bar moves to top of page; breadcrumbs hidden; footer links stack vertically |
| Tablet | 744–1128px | Nav bar shows 3–4 links; product cards in 2-column grid; search bar in nav; breadcrumbs visible; footer in 2 columns |
| Desktop | 1128–1440px | Full nav bar with all links; product cards in 3–4 column grid; search bar in nav; breadcrumbs visible; footer in 4 columns |
| Wide | > 1440px | Max-width container at 1440px; product cards in 5-column grid; all other elements remain same as desktop |

### Touch Targets
- All buttons and links: minimum 44px height, 44px width (icon-only)
- Search bar: 40px height, full width on mobile
- Nav hamburger icon: 44px x 44px tap area
- Product card: entire card is tappable, minimum 120px height
- Rating stars: 24px per star, 44px total tap area for the row

### Collapsing Strategy
- Nav links collapse to hamburger menu at < 744px
- Breadcrumbs hidden at < 744px
- Footer columns collapse from 4 to 2 to 1 as viewport shrinks
- Product card grid collapses from 5 to 4 to 3 to 2 to 1 columns
- Search bar moves from nav bar to a full-width row below the nav on mobile
- Category filter strip (if present) collapses to a horizontal scrollable row on mobile

## Known Gaps

- Only one hex color (#bf0000) was extracted from the live site — the rest of the palette (ink, body, muted, hairline, canvas, etc.) is inferred from common web patterns and may not match the exact brand values. A full design audit is needed to confirm grays, whites, and secondary accents.
- No font-family declarations beyond the system fallbacks (Arial, Georgia, Helvetica, Trebuchet MS, Verdana, serif, sans-serif) were found. Kobo likely uses a custom font (possibly a web font like “Kobo” or a licensed serif), but it was not extractable from the HTML. The typography block uses Trebuchet MS and Georgia as the closest available matches.
- Hover, focus, active, and disabled states for all components are assumed based on common patterns — the live site may use different colors, durations, or effects.
- Error styling for forms (border color, error message typography, icon placement) could not be extracted.
- Dark mode: not detected on the live site; no dark-mode palette is defined.
- Sub-brand palettes (Kobo Plus, Kobo eReaders, Kobo Audiobooks) may exist but were not extractable.
- The star-rating color (#f5a623) is a common yellow and may not be the brand’s actual rating color — a visual check is needed.
- Spacing and sizing values (padding, height, font sizes) are estimated from common e-commerce patterns and may not match the exact Kobo implementation.
