description: A bookish world built on parchment warmth — #e2d2b3, the brand's foundational canvas tone, reads like aged paper stock rather than sterile white, immediately signaling this is a subscription service for readers who treat books as objects of beauty. Deep navy ink (#233746) carries body copy and headlines, while a forest-green accent (#2f4d47) appears on badges, borders, and secondary CTAs as a quiet counterpoint to the expected book-club burgundy or gold. The extracted palette is unusually rich — over thirty distinct hex values — suggesting a brand that layers decorative swatches, limited-edition box colors, and seasonal accents rather than enforcing a tight system. Typography splits between Poppins (likely for display and buttons — clean, geometric, slightly playful) and Nunito (rounder, warmer, used for body and captions), with BrandonGro appearing in headlines and JustCosmic reserved for whimsical decorative moments. Buttons carry {rounded.sm} corners and a generous 48px height, while product cards use {rounded.md} and a soft drop shadow that lifts the box art off the page. The overall feel is that of a cozy, curated library — not minimalist, not maximalist, but deliberately layered: gold foil (#c69214) on limited-edition stamps, sage (#7c918d) on subscription tier cards, and a warm off-white (#f3ede1) for secondary surfaces. Every element seems designed to make the subscriber feel they've received something hand-assembled, not mass-produced.

## Components

### Buttons
**`button-primary`** — The primary call-to-action across the site, used for "Subscribe Now", "Add to Cart", and "Join the Waitlist". Rendered in forest green (`{colors.primary}`) with white text and {rounded.sm} corners. On hover, shifts to the deeper navy (`{colors.primary-active}`). Disabled state uses a muted gray (`{colors.primary-disabled}`) to clearly indicate non-interactivity. Height is fixed at 48px for consistency with form inputs.

**`button-secondary`** — Outlined-style button for secondary actions like "Learn More" or "View Details". Uses the warm parchment canvas (`{colors.canvas}`) as background with ink-colored text. On hover, the background fills with the softer parchment tone (`{colors.hairline-soft}`). Same 48px height and {rounded.sm} corners as the primary button for visual rhythm.

**`button-accent-gold`** — A special variant reserved for limited-edition drops, pre-order launches, and exclusive items. Gold background (`{colors.accent-gold}`) with dark ink text creates a premium, celebratory feel. Used sparingly to maintain its special status.

**`button-ghost`** — Text-only button with no background or border, used for "Cancel", "Skip This Month", or "View All". On hover, a subtle background tint may be applied, but the primary affordance comes from the text color and cursor change.

### Cards
**`product-card`** — The core content container for book boxes, individual titles, and merchandise. A white surface (`{colors.surface-card}`) with {rounded.md} corners and a soft drop shadow. The card image area maintains a 1:1 aspect ratio with matching corner radius. A gold badge (`{product-card-badge}`) overlays the top-left corner for "Signed Edition", "Exclusive", or "Best Seller" labels. Price is displayed in the brand's forest green (`{product-card-price}`) for quick scanning.

**`subscription-tier-card`** — Larger, more detailed card used on the subscription comparison page. Features {rounded.lg} corners and generous padding. The featured tier (e.g., "The Collector's Edition") gets a 2px gold border. A sage-green pill badge (`{subscription-tier-badge}`) labels the tier name. These cards stack vertically on mobile and form a three-column grid on desktop.

### Navigation
**`nav-bar`** — Fixed-height (72px) top navigation bar rendered on the warm parchment canvas. Logo sits left-aligned, with nav links (`{nav-link}`) spaced evenly. The active page link is underlined with a 2px forest-green border (`{nav-link-active}`). On scroll, the nav bar gains a white background and subtle shadow (`{nav-bar-sticky}`) for improved readability over page content.

**`nav-link`** — Individual navigation items with {rounded.xs} hover state. Uses Poppins at 14px with 0.3px letter-spacing for a clean, slightly elevated feel. Active state is indicated by the green underline rather than a background fill.

### Forms
**`text-input`** — Standard text input for search, email signup, and address forms. White background with a warm hairline border (`{colors.hairline}`). On focus, the border switches to forest green and a subtle ring appears (`{text-input-focus}`). Error state uses the red accent (`{text-input-error}`) for both border and text. Height matches buttons at 48px for aligned form rows.

**`search-bar`** — A pill-shaped search field (`{rounded.full}`) used in the header and on search results pages. White background with warm border. On focus, gains a green border and a soft green glow ring. The pill shape differentiates it from standard form inputs and signals its primary role as a discovery tool.

### Footer
**`footer-section`** — Full-width footer with a deep navy background (`{colors.ink}`) and light text. Links are rendered in the soft parchment tone (`{colors.hairline-soft}`) and shift to gold on hover. The footer contains navigation columns, social links, and legal text. Padding is generous at 48px top and bottom.

### Dividers & Decorations
**`divider`** — A 1px horizontal rule in the warm hairline color, used between sections and card elements. A softer variant (`{divider-soft}`) is used within cards and tight spaces where a lighter touch is needed.

## Responsive Behavior

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile | < 744px | Single-column layout; nav collapses to hamburger; product cards stack vertically; hero text reduces to {typography.display-md}; subscription tiers stack; search bar moves to expandable overlay |
| Tablet | 744–1128px | Two-column product grid; nav links remain visible but condensed; hero maintains two-column split; subscription tiers show 2-across; search bar remains in header |
| Desktop | 1128–1440px | Three-column product grid; full nav with all links; hero uses full display-xl; subscription tiers show 3-across; search bar is always visible |
| Wide | > 1440px | Max-width container (1440px) centered; extra whitespace on sides; product grid can show 4-across for certain categories; hero may include decorative side elements |

### Touch Targets
- All interactive elements (buttons, links, inputs) maintain a minimum 44px height for touch accessibility
- Icon buttons are 40px × 40px minimum
- Nav links have 8px vertical padding plus the 72px nav bar height for comfortable tapping
- Product card CTAs are full-width on mobile for easy thumb reach

### Collapsing Strategy
- Primary nav links collapse into a hamburger menu below 744px
- Secondary footer links collapse into accordion sections on mobile
- Product filters collapse into a slide-out drawer on mobile
- Multi-column subscription tier comparison collapses to a single-column vertical list
- Hero section reduces from two-column (text + image) to stacked single-column on mobile

## Known Gaps

- Hover and focus states for many components could not be reliably extracted from the live site; the tokens above represent best guesses based on common patterns
- Error states for forms (validation messages, error icons) were not observed on the homepage
- Dark mode or high-contrast mode styles are not present in the extracted data
- Sub-brand or seasonal color palettes (e.g., holiday editions, author collaborations) may exist but were not captured
- The exact font stack ordering and fallback chain for BrandonGro, JustCosmic, and FiraSans could not be confirmed from the extracted declarations
- Animation durations, easing curves, and transition properties were not extracted
- Drop shadow values for cards and modals are estimated based on common e-commerce patterns
- The decorative "JustCosmic" font usage context (headlines vs. accent text vs. logos) is inferred from its whimsical name
- Social media icon colors (Facebook blue `#3b5998`) are present in the palette but their exact usage context is unknown
- The extracted palette includes many colors that may be from stock imagery, limited-edition boxes, or third-party widgets rather than core brand tokens
