description: A void-black viewport forces a single spectral slash of red — #e5222a — to carry every interactive decision on the page, and that constraint defines everything downstream. Pre-built gaming towers and custom-configured rigs are photographed against negative space so complete that the chassis geometry reads like industrial sculpture rather than retail merchandise. Display type runs wide, condensed, and heavy — suggesting the typographic tradition of motorsport and aerospace spec sheets rather than the rounded, approachable geometry of consumer electronics — and model names like "VYBE", "RUSH", and "ELEMENT" appear at display-xl scale functioning closer to part numbers than marketing headlines. Hard corners ({rounded.none}) appear everywhere structural: build-config tables, spec cells, hero staging, form fields. Only logistics badges — "IN STOCK", "SHIPS TODAY" — earn a modest {rounded.xs} to signal their secondary, informational status.

The canvas resolves to near-void (#0d0d0d) rather than white, making the site feel more like a configuration terminal than a storefront. Spacing is technically dense: spec rows breathe at tight {spacing.sm}–{spacing.md} rhythm while section breaks open to {spacing.section} gulfs that let chassis photography assert itself. CTA buttons are flat, wide, and uppercase — the interaction language of BIOS screens and control panels — never the pill-shaped softness of D2C consumer goods. Secondary buttons invert to transparent with a red border so the dark field bleeds through, reinforcing depth rather than surface as Maingear's native medium. The accent (#e5222a) appears at full saturation only on interactive elements and active states — never diluted to a tint, never used as a fill — which keeps its signal value intact against an environment with almost no competing brightness.

Below the hero, commerce converts to a near-technical register: spec badges cluster in rows of four to six chips, each stamping GPU, RAM, and storage values in a monospace-adjacent face. The configurator panel — CPU tier, GPU family, RAM density, storage — operates like a structured form rather than a guided wizard, with active selections marked by a border upgrade from hairline gray to primary red rather than a checkbox glyph or highlight fill. The footer condenses every product line, configurator entry point, warranty clause, and social handle into a dense dark grid, treating discovery as a technical index rather than a brand narrative.

## Components

### Buttons

**`button-primary`** — Flat, zero-radius red (#e5222a) slab with all-caps condensed lettering at 1.5px tracking. On hover it transitions to `primary-active` (#c01820) with no easing delay — the interaction pattern mimics a physical key press rather than a soft UI affordance. Disabled state uses `primary-disabled` at half opacity, ensuring it reads as deliberately inactive rather than accidentally invisible against the dark canvas. Width typically locks to a fixed value (180–220px) rather than shrinking to content, giving CTA rows visual weight parity across product cards.

**`button-secondary`** — Transparent fill with a 1px `primary-ghost-border` red edge and white uppercase label; the dark canvas bleeds through, giving the button a bordered-void look. On hover, `surface-soft` fills in — just enough brightness shift to confirm the state without breaking the dark-field illusion. Used paired alongside `button-primary` in hero and product detail layouts, always at the same height (48px) so the two buttons optically match.

**`button-ghost`** — Hairline-bordered utility button with `muted` text; used for tertiary actions like "Compare" or "Add to Wishlist" on product cards where the primary CTA is already present. Never uses red — keeps the accent reserved for decisive, transactional moments.

### Text Input

**`text-input`** — Near-black fill (`surface-soft`) with a 1px `hairline` border and zero border-radius that extends the angular design language from buttons into form fields. Focus replaces the border color with `primary` red rather than adding an outer glow, maintaining the flat surface read. Placeholder text sits in `muted` (#888888) against the dark fill; typed text in `ink` (#ffffff) creates an immediate, high-contrast confirmation of input.

### Navigation

**`nav-bar`** — 64px dark bar flush with the `canvas`; product categories ("DESKTOPS", "LAPTOPS", "CUSTOMIZE", "ACCESSORIES") at `nav-link` weight with no persistent underline — hover triggers a bottom border in `primary` red. Logo anchors the left; cart, search, and account icons cluster right as SVG glyphs. On scroll past the hero, a 1px `hairline` bottom border separates the bar from the page surface below it.

**`nav-dropdown`** — Dark panel (`surface-card`, 1px `hairline` border, no rounding) that opens below the nav on category hover. Product sub-lines and featured pre-built systems appear in a two-column grid with small preview images. No drop shadow — the panel edge defines the boundary against the dark background.

### Product Card

**`product-card`** — Dark card (`surface-card`, 1px `hairline` border) that upgrades its border to 1px `primary` red on hover. Product image fills the upper 4:3 zone; model name at `title-sm`, price at `price-display` (28px condensed), and a `button-primary` CTA anchor the lower section. `stock-badge` and `sale-badge` chips overlay the image at top-left corner at `caption` scale. Zero border-radius throughout; the card reads as a panel from a dashboard, not a marketplace tile.

### Hero

**`hero`** — Full-bleed chassis photography with a left-anchored gradient scrim (`rgba(0,0,0,0.85)` fading to transparent at 60%) that ensures headline legibility without boxing the image. Model name in `display-xl` (72px, uppercase, −2px tracking) and a single `button-primary` CTA sit in the left column at `section` vertical padding. Background position anchors the chassis at center-right so the product occupies the unobscured right half of the frame. Minimum height 560px; expands to 640px on wide viewports.

### Spec Badge

**`spec-badge`** — Small horizontal chip (`surface-raised`, 1px `hairline` border, zero radius) with a `caption` label above a `spec-mono` value. Used in clusters of four to six across product card footers and product detail pages — GPU model, RAM size, storage type, display spec — giving at-a-glance hardware comparison without requiring the user to open a full spec sheet. Chips wrap to two rows on card widths below 280px.

### Configurator Panel

**`configurator-panel`** — The commerce core of the Maingear experience; each hardware tier (CPU, GPU, RAM, storage, cooling, OS) gets a card panel with a `title-md` section header and a list of radio-style option rows. Active selection upgrades the panel border from 1px `hairline` to 1px `primary` red. Option rows show the part name at `body-sm` and the price delta (e.g. "+$200") at `body-sm` `muted` — the configurator reads as a structured technical form, not a guided wizard.

### Config Table

**`config-table`** — Striped two-column spec readout used in product detail summaries and comparison views. Label column in `body-sm` at `muted` color; value column in `spec-mono` for character-level alignment across rows. The currently highlighted row gets a 2px left-side border in `primary` — a single column of red in an otherwise monochrome table, functioning like a cursor indicator.

### Promo Banner

**`promo-banner`** — Full-width 40px red strip pinned above the nav bar for time-sensitive messaging ("FREE SHIPPING OVER $99", "LABOR DAY SALE — UP TO $400 OFF"). Typography at `button-sm` uppercase. No close affordance — the banner is editorial broadcast, not a dismissible notification. On mobile it wraps to two lines and grows height to fit.

### Category Tab

**`category-tab`** — Horizontal tab strip used to filter product listings by tier ("ALL", "ENTRY", "MID-RANGE", "ENTHUSIAST", "ULTIMATE"). Active state: `ink` white text plus a 2px `primary` bottom border. Inactive: `muted` text, no border. No background fill change on any state — the active indicator is purely the bottom edge, consistent with the flat-surface design language.

### Footer

**`footer`** — Four-column dark grid (`surface-soft`, 1px `hairline` top border) with `caption` heading labels and `body-sm` link lists. Social icons appear beneath the last column or in a dedicated fifth column. Copyright and legal links run at `body-sm` in `muted` along the bottom edge. No decorative graphics or gradients — the footer is a technical index, not a brand story closer.

## Responsive Behavior

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile | < 744px | Single-column layout; hero headline drops to `display-md` (32px); nav collapses to hamburger with slide-out drawer; product cards stack full-width; configurator panels become accordion rows; spec badges reduce to 3 chips |
| Tablet | 744–1128px | Two-column product grid; hero maintains left-text / right-image split with tighter padding; top nav shows primary categories only, secondary nav in drawer; configurator panels stack vertically |
| Desktop | 1128–1440px | Three-column product grid; configurator splits into left-panel options and right-panel sticky summary; full horizontal nav with dropdowns; `display-xl` headlines at full 72px |
| Wide | > 1440px | Content max-width caps at 1440px and centers; hero padding expands to `{spacing.section}` × 2; four-column product grid available for listing pages |

### Touch Targets

- All buttons and nav links maintain a minimum 44px tap height on mobile
- Configurator option rows expand to 52px tap height on touch devices to accommodate radio-style selection
- Product card CTA buttons span full card width on mobile for maximum tap area
- Spec badge chips maintain 36px min height on touch viewports with increased horizontal padding

### Collapsing Strategy

- Nav collapses to hamburger icon at < 744px; cart and search icons remain persistent in the top bar
- Promo banner wraps to two lines on mobile rather than hiding — logistics messaging is purchase-critical
- Config table collapses to single-column key → value rows with `{spacing.sm}` row gap; left accent border moves to a top accent border on mobile
- Spec badge clusters reduce from 6 chips to 4 on tablet, 3 on mobile (GPU, RAM, storage prioritized)
- Category tab strip becomes horizontally scrollable with soft fade mask at < 744px — no wrapping or line break

## Known Gaps

- **All colors are brand-knowledge estimates; no hex values were extracted.** The site returned no color tokens from automated extraction (likely JS-rendered token system or anti-bot protection). Primary red (#e5222a) is based on widely visible Maingear brand assets and marketing materials; exact swatch must be verified against live CSS custom properties or official brand guidelines.
- **Font families not extracted.** No font-family stack was detected. Typography uses Barlow Condensed / Barlow as plausible replacements consistent with the condensed-display gaming aesthetic; actual typefaces may differ.
- **No meta theme-color tag detected.** Cannot confirm the canonical accent via this secondary signal.
- **No Shopify platform confirmed.** Commerce infrastructure (cart, configurator, checkout) may involve custom or headless implementation; component states here model surface appearance only, not checkout or compatibility validation logic.
- **Configurator flow depth unknown.** Maingear's custom PC builder involves multi-step compatibility checking; the `configurator-panel` component models visual states only, not conflict UX, part availability gates, or price recalculation behavior.
- **Dark-mode assumption unverified.** Always-dark treatment assumed based on category norms; a light-mode or adaptive-mode variant may exist and was not confirmed or ruled out by extraction.
- **Icon set, illustration style, and animation timings** could not be characterized from extraction data.
