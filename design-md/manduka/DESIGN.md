description: A deep, quiet studio presence built on a near-black ink (#141414) and a single shot of deep teal (#011f31) that reads like the color of a yoga mat after a hot class — dark, calm, and slightly wet. The brand's primary accent is a muted gold (#8e8733), not a bright CTA color, used sparingly on sale badges and small highlights; it feels like a brass gong rather than a digital button. The canvas is a warm off-white (#f6f6f6) that avoids the sterile hospital white of most DTC sites, and the entire layout breathes through generous whitespace and a restrained typographic system built on Assistant and Inter at modest weights. Product cards use soft rounded corners (`{rounded.sm}` ~8px) and thin hairlines (#dedede) that suggest a premium mat unrolled on a clean floor. There are no hard edges, no aggressive CTAs, no urgency — the site trusts the product photography (yogis in deep poses, mat textures, studio light) to do the selling. The nav bar is a thin, fixed strip with the logo centered, category links in lowercase, and a small cart icon; the search icon is a simple line glyph, not a pill. The footer runs dark (#141414) with gold links, a newsletter signup, and a sustainability badge. The overall mood is "the studio before class starts" — hushed, intentional, and built for longevity.

## Components

### Buttons
**`button-primary`** — The primary call-to-action, used for "Add to Cart", "Shop Now", and "Subscribe". Rendered in deep teal (#011f31) with white text and soft 8px corners. On hover, shifts to a slightly lighter teal (#0a2e42). Disabled state uses a muted gray-blue (#7a8d99) to signal inactivity without visual noise.
**`button-secondary`** — An outlined or ghost variant used for "Learn More" and secondary actions on product pages. Uses the warm canvas background (#f6f6f6) with dark ink text (#141414) and a thin hairline border. Active state fills with the softest gray (#f3f3f3).
**`button-gold`** — Reserved for sale events, limited drops, and promotional banners. Uses the muted gold accent (#8e8733) with dark text (#141414). Hover brightens to (#a69e3d). Never used as a primary CTA — it's a signal of value, not urgency.
**`button-text`** — A text-only link styled as a button, used for "View Details" and "Read Reviews". No background, no border — just the ink color and the button typography weight. A gold variant (`button-text-gold`) exists for footer and dark-background contexts.

### Navigation
**`nav-bar`** — A fixed 64px strip with white background (#f6f6f6) and a thin bottom border (#f3f3f3). The Manduka logo sits centered; category links (Mats, Props, Apparel, etc.) are rendered in uppercase 14px weight-500 type. Active nav links get a 2px teal underline. The cart icon is a simple line drawing, and the search icon sits to the right — both in muted gray (#a1a1a1). On mobile, the nav collapses into a hamburger menu with a full-screen overlay.

### Cards
**`product-card`** — A clean, minimal card with a 1:1 product image (soft top corners at 8px) and text below. The title uses 16px weight-600, the price is 16px weight-400 in body gray (#545454). Sale prices switch to gold (#8e8733). No badge by default — sale and new badges (`badge-sale`, `badge-new`) are applied as overlays on the image. Cards have no border; they rely on the white surface against the warm canvas background for separation.
**`review-card`** — A bordered card (1px #f3f3f3) with 8px corners, used in product review sections. Contains a star rating in gold (#8e8733), the reviewer name, and a short body-sm excerpt. Padding is 16px all around.

### Forms
**`text-input`** — Standard input field with 8px corners, 48px height, and a thin hairline border (#dedede). Focus state swaps the border to teal (#011f31). Error state uses a warm red (#c13515). Used for search, newsletter signup, and checkout forms.
**`newsletter-input`** — A footer-specific input on the dark background (#141414). Border is the muted footer text (#a1a1a1). The placeholder text is also muted. The submit button is the gold variant.
**`quantity-selector`** — A compact 40px input with +/- buttons, used on product detail pages for cart quantity. Same styling as text-input but narrower padding.

### Badges
**`badge-sale`** — A small uppercase label in gold (#8e8733) with dark text (#141414). 2px horizontal padding, 2px vertical. Used as a corner overlay on product images.
**`badge-new`** — Same shape and size as sale badge, but in teal (#011f31) with white text. Used for new arrivals and limited collections.

### Footer
**`footer`** — A full-width dark section (#141414) with three columns: customer service links, about links, and a newsletter signup. Text is muted gray (#a1a1a1) at 14px. Links use gold (#8e8733) on hover. The newsletter input matches the footer's dark theme. A thin gold line separates the link columns from the copyright row.

## Responsive Behavior

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile | < 744px | Nav collapses to hamburger; product grid goes 1 column; hero text centers; footer stacks vertically |
| Tablet | 744–1128px | Nav shows 4-5 categories; product grid 2 columns; hero text left-aligned; footer 2 columns |
| Desktop | 1128–1440px | Full nav with all categories; product grid 3 columns; hero has full-width image; footer 3 columns |
| Wide | > 1440px | Max-width container (1440px) centered; product grid 4 columns; larger hero typography |

### Touch Targets
- All buttons and links: minimum 44x44px touch target
- Nav links: 48px tap area (64px nav bar height ensures this)
- Quantity selector +/- buttons: 40x40px minimum
- Product card tap target: entire card is clickable
- Accordion headers: 48px minimum tap height

### Collapsing Strategy
- Nav bar: categories collapse into hamburger menu below 744px
- Footer: 3-column layout collapses to 2 columns at tablet, 1 column at mobile
- Product grid: 4 columns on wide → 3 on desktop → 2 on tablet → 1 on mobile
- Hero section: full-width image on desktop becomes stacked (image above text) on mobile
- Accordion: all product detail accordions start collapsed on mobile; first accordion open on desktop

## Known Gaps

- Extracted hex colors include several grays and one distinctive gold (#8e8733) and teal (#011f31) — these are likely the true brand colors, but the extraction may have missed secondary accents (e.g., a specific green for sustainability messaging, or a warm tone for "studio" photography backgrounds). The gold appears only in sale badges and small highlights; its full usage (e.g., hover states, loading spinners) is inferred.
- Font-family declarations found: Assistant, Inter, arial, europa — "europa" may be a legacy or fallback font; the primary system appears to be Assistant for headings and Inter for body. Exact font-weight mapping (e.g., 600 vs 700 for display) is inferred from common DTC patterns and may differ on the live site.
- No meta theme-color was extracted; the brand may use a browser chrome color that wasn't captured.
- Hover states for text inputs, accordion headers, and footer links are inferred from common patterns — not extracted.
- Error styling (input validation, form errors, toast messages) is not present in extracted data; colors for error/success are estimated from industry standards.
- Dark mode: not detected on the live site; the brand may not support it.
- Sub-brand or collection-specific palettes (e.g., "PRO" series mats, "eKO" sustainable line) may use distinct accent colors not captured in the top hex extraction.
- Star rating color (#8e8733) is inferred from the gold accent; the actual rating component may use a different gold or a filled/empty star pattern not captured.
- The extracted hex list includes #0f3d81 (a blue) which may be a Shopify widget or social icon color — not used in the brand palette.
