description: A literary institution that wears its seriousness lightly, McSweeney's Internet Tendency builds its digital home on a warm, almost sepia-toned foundation of #1a1a17 and #fff3e0 — the deep, ink-black brown of a well-worn book spine and the soft cream of aged paper. The palette is deliberately restrained: #2a2a26 and #3a3a36 for body text, #8a8a84 and #9e9e98 for muted captions and metadata, with #e8e6df and #c8c8c0 forming the hairline borders and surface edges that give the layout its quiet, bookish structure. Against this sober ground, two accents provide the voltage: #5bb8f5, a clear, literary blue used for links and interactive elements, and #2a2000, a deep amber-brown that surfaces in headings and blockquotes, evoking the warm glow of a reading lamp. The typography leans on Garamond Premier Pro and Baskerville for display and body text — serif faces that signal literary credibility without pretension — while Avenir and Helvetica Neue handle UI labels and navigation, creating a deliberate tension between the timeless and the functional. Buttons are softly rectangular with {rounded.sm} corners, never pill-shaped; the search bar is a simple outlined field, not a glowing orb. The site trusts its content — long-form humor, essays, and fiction — over chrome, using generous {spacing.section} margins and a single-column reading rhythm that lets the words breathe. The blue link color #5bb8f5 is the only bright element in an otherwise muted world, making every click feel like a deliberate choice.

## Components

### Buttons
**`button-primary`** — The primary call-to-action, rendered in McSweeney's distinctive blue (#5bb8f5) against the warm cream canvas. Uses Avenir Next at 14px weight 600 with tight letter-spacing for a clean, editorial feel. Corners are softly squared at {rounded.sm} (4px), never pill-shaped. On hover, the background shifts to the lighter #89d0ff; disabled state drops to the muted #a0a09a with cream text. Secondary buttons invert the scheme — cream background, ink text, a thin hairline border — and hover to reveal a soft surface tint. Ghost buttons exist for inline actions like "Read more" or "Subscribe," using only the blue link color with no background.

### Cards
**`article-card`** — The fundamental content unit of the site. A white card with no border-radius, separated from its neighbors by a single hairline-soft rule. Each card contains a display-md title in Garamond Premier Pro, a caption-line of metadata (author, date, category badge), and a body-sm excerpt. On hover, the card gains a subtle #f5f5f5 background tint. The category badge sits in the top-left corner as a small uppercase label in Avenir Next, either in the primary blue for new content or muted gray for archived pieces.

### Navigation
**`nav-bar`** — A 56px cream bar spanning the full viewport width, anchored by the McSweeney's wordmark on the left and a row of nav links on the right. Links are set in Avenir Next 14px weight 600 with generous letter-spacing. The active page is indicated by a 2px blue underline; inactive links render in muted gray. On mobile, the nav collapses into a hamburger menu with a full-screen overlay. The search bar lives as a separate element below the nav on desktop, or inside the mobile menu.

### Forms
**`text-input`** — Standard form fields for search, newsletter signup, and submission forms. White background with a hairline border, 4px corners, and 14px padding. On focus, the border turns blue and a 2px blue ring appears. The search bar follows the same pattern but is slightly shorter (40px) and sits in a dedicated search section below the nav on the homepage.

### Footer
**`footer`** — A deep ink (#1a1a17) footer that grounds the page. Links appear in the primary blue, set in Avenir Next caption size. The footer contains three columns on desktop: About, Categories, and Follow. Copyright and legal text sit in a smaller caption-sm size at the bottom. Padding is generous at {spacing.xxl} top and bottom, creating a visual rest after the content.

### Blockquotes & Section Headings
**`blockquote-component`** — Pull quotes and blockquotes are rendered in italic Garamond Premier Pro at 22px, colored in the deep amber #2a2000, with a 3px left border in the same hue and a soft cream background. Section headings use display-lg Garamond with a 2px amber underline, signaling a new thematic section.

## Responsive Behavior

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile | < 744px | Single-column layout; nav collapses to hamburger; article cards stack with no side margins; search bar moves inside mobile menu; footer stacks to single column; section padding reduces to 32px |
| Tablet | 744–1128px | Two-column article grid possible; nav links remain visible but condensed; search bar sits below nav; footer shows two columns |
| Desktop | 1128–1440px | Full layout: single-column reading rhythm for articles; three-column footer; nav at full width; search bar prominent below nav |
| Wide | > 1440px | Max-width container at 1128px for content; nav and footer stretch full viewport; increased side margins for readability |

### Touch Targets
- All interactive elements (buttons, links, inputs) maintain minimum 44x44px touch targets
- Nav links on mobile menu have 48px tap height
- Article card tap targets are the full card width, minimum 64px height
- Search bar submit button is 44x44px minimum

### Collapsing Strategy
- Top nav links collapse into hamburger menu below 744px
- Footer columns collapse from three to one below 744px
- Article grid collapses from two columns to single column below 744px
- Search bar collapses from visible element to menu item below 744px
- Category badges hide on mobile, replaced by color-coded dots

## Known Gaps

- Extracted color palette is heavily weighted toward grays and neutrals (#1a1a17 through #fafafa) with only two distinctive accents: #5bb8f5 (blue) and #2a2000 (amber). The blue was selected as primary based on its use as the only saturated link color in the extracted data. The amber tones (#2a2000, #3a2800, #5a3800) may represent a secondary accent palette for headings and blockquotes, but their exact usage rules could not be confirmed.
- Font stack extracted from CSS includes Garamond Premier Pro, Baskerville, Avenir, and Helvetica Neue, but exact size/weight pairings for all typography tokens are inferred from common literary-site patterns rather than extracted from live CSS.
- Hover states for buttons and links are inferred from the extracted primary-active (#89d0ff) and link-hover (#00b0ff) values, but exact transition durations and shadow effects are unknown.
- Error states for forms (validation, error messages) could not be extracted.
- Dark mode is not confirmed; the extracted palette includes some dark values (#212121, #2e2e2a) that may indicate a dark theme, but no toggle or media-query preference was found.
- Sub-brand or section-specific color variations (e.g., for different McSweeney's series or store products) are not captured.
- The site may use a custom serif font (Garamond Premier Pro) via Adobe Fonts or similar service; the exact font-face declarations and loading strategy are unknown.
- Spacing values are estimated from common literary-site patterns; exact padding/margin values for all components could not be extracted.
- Badge and tag color variants (e.g., for different content types) are speculative.
- The meta theme-color tag was absent, suggesting no browser chrome theming is implemented.
