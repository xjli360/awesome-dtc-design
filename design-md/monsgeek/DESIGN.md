description: A mechanical-keyboard brand that builds its visual identity around a deep, confident blue (#006799) — not the playful pastels or industrial grays typical of the hobby, but a saturated primary that reads as both premium and approachable. The brand tagline "Make Cool Gears Accessible" is reflected in a design system that balances enthusiast-grade detail with clean, uncluttered interfaces. Type runs on Poppins across three weights (Regular, Medium, Bold), with display sizes that lean into the geometric, slightly technical feel of the font — uppercase badges and tight letter-spacing on buttons echo the precision of keyboard switches. The palette extends into a controlled range of greens (#1e3828, #0f1f18) and accent tones (#82c0c7, #9de1bc) that suggest PCB colors and keycap gradients without overwhelming the primary blue. Cards and containers use soft rounding ({rounded.sm} to {rounded.md}), while CTAs and badges adopt pill shapes ({rounded.full}) that contrast with the otherwise rectilinear product photography. The system relies on a warm off-white canvas (#eeeeee) rather than pure white, giving the storefront a slightly softer, more editorial feel than the stark black-and-white of many tech brands. Navigation stays minimal — a single top bar with dropdowns, no mega-menus — letting the product grid do the heavy lifting. The extracted palette includes a wide range of generic web colors (multiple grays, blues, and bright accents like #f78da7 and #ff6900), suggesting either a WordPress-based backend or third-party widget integrations; the true brand voice lives in the consistent use of #006799 across primary actions, headers, and key links.

## Components

### Buttons
**`button-primary`** — The primary call-to-action across the site, rendered in the brand blue (#006799) with white uppercase Poppins Medium text. Hover state darkens to `{colors.primary-active}` (#005580). Disabled state fades to a pale blue `{colors.primary-disabled}` (#b3d4e6). Used for "Add to Cart", "Buy Now", and primary form submissions.

**`button-secondary`** — An outlined or ghost-style button on the warm off-white canvas (`{colors.canvas}` #eeeeee). Hover adds a soft background fill (`{colors.hairline-soft}` #ededed). Used for "Learn More", "View Details", and secondary actions.

**`button-ghost`** — Text-only button with the brand blue as the text color, no background or border. Used for inline actions like "Clear Filters" or "Cancel".

**`button-pill`** — A compact, fully rounded button (`{rounded.full}`) with smaller uppercase text. Used for quick-add actions on product cards, filter resets, or promotional badges.

### Cards
**`product-card`** — The core product display unit. A white card (`{colors.surface-card}`) with soft 12px rounding (`{rounded.md}`). The product image sits at the top with rounded top corners only, creating a subtle separation from the text below. The title uses `{typography.title-sm}` (16px Poppins Medium) and the price uses `{typography.price}` (18px Poppins Medium). Hover state adds a light box shadow for depth.

### Navigation
**`nav-bar`** — A fixed or sticky top navigation bar at 64px height on the warm canvas background. Links use `{typography.nav-link}` (14px Poppins Medium with 0.3px letter-spacing). Dropdown menus appear as white cards with soft 8px rounding and tight padding.

**`nav-dropdown`** — A white card panel that appears on hover or click of nav items. Contains product category links in `{typography.body-sm}`.

### Forms
**`text-input`** — Standard text input fields with a white background, 1px hairline border (`{colors.hairline}` #e5e7eb), and 8px rounding. On focus, the border thickens to 2px and switches to the brand blue. Used for search, email signup, and checkout forms.

**`search-bar`** — A pill-shaped search input (`{rounded.full}`) with a white background and hairline border. On focus, the border becomes 2px brand blue. Used in the header for product search.

### Badges
**`badge`** — Small uppercase labels in Poppins Bold at 11px with 0.8px letter-spacing. The default badge uses the brand blue background. Variants include `badge-sale` (red #cf2e2e for discounts) and `badge-new` (green #7bdcb5 for new arrivals). All badges use 4px rounding (`{rounded.xs}`) and tight 2px/8px padding.

### Filters
**`filter-chip`** — Pill-shaped filter toggles (`{rounded.full}`) at 32px height with soft background (`{colors.surface-soft}`). Active state fills with the brand blue and white text. Used in product listing pages for category, switch type, and layout filters.

### Hero
**`hero-banner`** — Full-width promotional banner with the brand blue background and white text. Uses `{typography.display-xl}` (36px Poppins Bold) for the headline and `{typography.body-md}` for the subtitle. Padding is generous at 64px vertical.

### Footer
**`footer`** — A dark footer section with near-black background (`{colors.ink}` #111111) and muted gray text (`{colors.muted-soft}` #9ca3af). Links use `{typography.link}` (14px Poppins Regular). Vertical padding is 48px, with 64px horizontal padding on desktop.

### Pagination
**`pagination-button`** — Square-ish buttons (8px rounding) for page navigation. Active page uses the brand blue fill; inactive pages use the warm canvas background. Each button is 36px tall with 8px/12px padding.

## Responsive Behavior

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile | < 744px | Single-column product grid (1-2 columns). Nav collapses to hamburger menu. Hero banner reduces padding to 32px. Filter chips stack vertically. Search bar moves to a dedicated overlay. Footer links stack in single column. |
| Tablet | 744–1128px | Two-column product grid. Nav remains visible with condensed links. Filter chips wrap in a horizontal strip. Hero banner uses 48px padding. Footer uses 2-3 column layout. |
| Desktop | 1128–1440px | Three-column product grid. Full nav with dropdowns. Filter chips in horizontal row. Hero banner at full padding (64px). Footer in 4-column layout. |
| Wide | > 1440px | Four-column product grid. Max-width container (1440px) for content. Hero banner may use a wider background with constrained text. Footer remains 4-column with max-width. |

### Touch Targets
- All buttons and interactive elements maintain minimum 44px height for touch accessibility.
- Filter chips are 32px height — acceptable for touch but could be increased to 36px on mobile.
- Nav dropdowns have 8px padding around links to ensure 44px tap targets.
- Search bar is 44px height on all breakpoints.

### Collapsing Strategy
- Primary navigation collapses to a hamburger icon below 744px.
- Product grid reduces from 4 columns (wide) to 3 (desktop) to 2 (tablet) to 1 (mobile).
- Filter chips stack vertically on mobile; horizontal scroll on tablet.
- Footer links collapse from 4 columns to 2 columns on tablet, single column on mobile.
- Hero banner text reduces in size on mobile (from 36px to 24px).
- Search bar becomes a full-screen overlay on mobile with larger input field.

## Known Gaps

- Extracted hex colors include many generic web palette colors (multiple grays, blues, and bright accent colors like #f78da7, #ff6900, #fcb900, #7bdcb5, #8ed1fc, #0693e3, #9b51e0, #974df3, #7e3bd0) that likely come from WordPress theme defaults, WooCommerce widgets, or third-party integrations rather than the brand's intentional palette. The true brand primary (#006799) and secondary greens (#1e3828, #0f1f18, #82c0c7, #9de1bc) were identified by frequency and contextual usage.
- Font-family declarations include "Open Sans" and "DM Sans" alongside Poppins — these may be fallback fonts or used in specific widget areas. Poppins was chosen as the primary brand font based on the three weight-specific declarations (Poppins-Bold, Poppins-Medium, Poppins-Regular).
- Hover states for buttons and cards are inferred from common e-commerce patterns, not extracted from live CSS.
- Error and validation styling (form errors, out-of-stock states) not available from extraction.
- Dark mode or high-contrast mode not detected.
- Animation durations, easing curves, and transition properties not extracted.
- Box shadows and elevation levels not reliably extracted from the live site.
- Iconography style and sizing not determined — the site may use custom SVG icons or a library.
- Product card image aspect ratios and dimensions not confirmed.
- Checkout flow styling (cart, shipping, payment) not captured — may use a third-party checkout.
