description: A charcoal-and-sulfur brand identity built on the tension between #6f6f6f — a warm, mid-tone gray that reads as stone, concrete, or raw aluminum — and #ffff00, a pure signal-yellow that arrives like a safety vest on a minimalist electronics accessory. The brand sells phone cables, wireless chargers, and carrying cases, but the design language borrows from industrial hardware and heritage luggage: woven nylon braids, leather wraps, and anodized-metal finishes. Typography splits between Playfair Display for editorial headings (a serif that suggests a luxury-goods catalog) and Montserrat for interface labels (a geometric sans-serif that keeps the UI from feeling precious). Buttons are pill-shaped (`{rounded.full}`) but rendered in the charcoal gray rather than the yellow, making the yellow a rare accent — used only for select highlights, badges, and the occasional CTA. The product grid favors generous whitespace and single-column hero shots, letting the texture of the materials (braided cable, matte silicone, woven fabric) carry the visual weight. There is no gradient, no drop shadow, no decorative illustration — the brand trusts material photography and a strict two-color palette to signal quality. The result is a digital storefront that feels more like a precision-tool catalog than a phone-accessory shop: restrained, tactile without being "tactile" in the marketing sense, and utterly dependent on the contrast between warm gray and cold yellow.

## Components

### Buttons
**`button-primary`** — The primary call-to-action, rendered in signal yellow (#ffff00) with uppercase Montserrat 14px/600 and full-pill rounding. On hover, the yellow deepens to #e6e600; the disabled state fades to #ffff99 with muted text. The button carries 14px vertical padding and 32px horizontal padding, giving it a substantial, weighty feel that contrasts with the otherwise restrained palette.

**`button-secondary`** — A charcoal-gray (#6f6f6f) pill with white text, used for secondary actions like "Learn More" or "Add to Cart" when the primary yellow would overwhelm. Active state darkens to #5a5a5a. Same dimensions as primary to maintain rhythm.

**`button-outline`** — A transparent button with a 2px solid black border and black text, used for tertiary actions or when the background is already yellow or gray. The outline variant preserves the full-pill shape and uppercase typography, ensuring all buttons read as a coherent family.

### Navigation
**`nav-bar`** — A white, 72px-tall fixed header with a thin bottom border (#e6e6e6). Navigation links are set in Montserrat 13px/600 with 0.8px letter spacing and uppercase — a deliberate choice that reads more like a fashion label's menu than a tech accessory store. The logo sits left-aligned at 28px height. On scroll, the nav gains a subtle box-shadow (not specified in tokens but observed in production).

**`nav-logo`** — The Native Union wordmark or monogram, rendered at 28px height. The logo itself is typically black or dark gray, maintaining the brand's low-contrast, industrial aesthetic.

### Product Cards
**`product-card`** — A minimal, borderless card with no rounding, relying entirely on the product photography and whitespace for structure. The image area sits on a soft gray (#f5f5f5) background to handle transparent PNGs or product shots with white backgrounds. Below the image, the product title appears in Montserrat 18px/600, followed by the price in 16px/400 in muted gray (#6f6f6f). No rating stars, no reviews count, no "add to cart" button on the card — the brand trusts the product detail page for conversion.

**`badge-new`** — A yellow (#ffff00) pill badge with uppercase 10px/700 Montserrat, used sparingly to denote new arrivals. The badge sits at the top-left corner of the product image, overlapping the photo area.

**`badge-sale`** — A charcoal-gray (#6f6f6f) badge with white text, used for sale or clearance items. Same dimensions and typography as the new badge, but the color swap signals a different category of attention.

### Forms
**`text-input`** — A white input field with a 1px light-gray border (#d4d4d4) and 8px rounding. On focus, the border thickens to 2px and shifts to charcoal (#6f6f6f), creating a subtle but clear active state. The input height is 48px, matching the button height for aligned form layouts.

**`search-bar`** — A full-pill search input with a soft-gray background (#f5f5f5) and a 1px hairline border. The pill shape mirrors the button family, making the search bar feel like an action rather than a passive field. Placeholder text is set in Montserrat 16px/400.

### Footer
**`footer`** — A black (#1a1a1a) footer with white body text and muted-gray (#9e9e9e) links. The footer uses the section spacing token (80px) for vertical padding, creating a generous breathing room that matches the brand's overall whitespace philosophy. Social icons are rendered in the muted-gray tone, not white, to avoid visual competition with the text.

## Responsive Behavior

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile | < 744px | Single-column product grid; nav collapses to hamburger; hero heading drops to 28px; buttons go full-width; footer stacks vertically |
| Tablet | 744–1128px | Two-column product grid; nav links visible but condensed; hero heading at 36px; buttons remain inline but may stack in forms |
| Desktop | 1128–1440px | Three-column product grid; full nav with uppercase links; hero at 42px; standard button sizing |
| Wide | > 1440px | Max-width container at 1440px, centered; product grid may expand to four columns; hero remains centered with generous margins |

### Touch Targets
- All buttons and interactive elements maintain a minimum 48px height for touch accessibility.
- Nav links have 44px minimum tap targets (padding + link height).
- Search bar is 56px tall on mobile, 48px on desktop.
- Product card images are tappable with no minimum size requirement (the entire card is a link).

### Collapsing Strategy
- Primary nav collapses to a hamburger menu at < 744px.
- Product grid collapses from 3 columns → 2 columns → 1 column as viewport shrinks.
- Footer link columns collapse to a single stacked column on mobile.
- Hero section reduces vertical padding from 80px to 48px on mobile.
- Search bar remains visible at all breakpoints (does not collapse into an icon).

## Known Gaps

- Only two extracted hex colors (#6f6f6f and #ffff00) were available from the live site scan. The brand likely uses additional shades (e.g., a lighter gray for hover states, a darker gray for footer backgrounds, a specific white for cards) — these have been inferred from common patterns and the brand's industrial aesthetic but should be verified against the actual design system.
- Hover, focus, and active states for most components are inferred from standard accessibility patterns rather than extracted from the site.
- Error states (form validation, 404 pages, empty states) are not documented.
- The brand may use a secondary accent color (e.g., a muted blue or green) that was not captured in the extraction.
- Font weights and exact sizes for Playfair Display and Montserrat are estimated based on common web usage; the actual type scale may differ.
- The brand's dark mode (if any) is not documented.
- Spacing tokens are based on standard design-system patterns and may not match the exact grid used in production.
- The `textTransform: uppercase` on button and nav-link typography is inferred from the brand's aesthetic; the actual site may use mixed case.
