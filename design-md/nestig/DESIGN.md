description: A nursery brand that builds its visual language around a deep, confident navy (#173482) and a warm, blush-adjacent clay (#e6c9c1), a pairing that reads as both heirloom-solid and tender. The palette is unusually generous — a full spectrum of muted earth tones (#965f44, #bf7f4c, #c1996c), soft pinks (#e2c4c9, #e7bacc), and airy blues (#8fbed4, #c2e6fa, #aac4e7) that suggest a brand unafraid of color in a category that often defaults to all-white or all-gray. The primary navy (#173482) carries CTAs and key structural elements, while the clay (#e6c9c1) appears in secondary surfaces and accent blocks, creating a warm counterpoint. The type system leans on Matter and Gooper for display moments — Matter brings a geometric, almost architectural precision to headings, while True North Script introduces a hand-lettered, personal note in hero titles and badges. Assistant serves as the workhorse body face, keeping product descriptions and navigation legible at small sizes. Rounded corners are restrained: cards and inputs use a soft 8px (`{rounded.sm}`), while badges and small decorative elements may go fully pill-shaped (`{rounded.full}`). The canvas is a warm off-white (#f9f5f2) rather than pure white, giving every page a lived-in, nursery-at-dusk quality. Nestig trusts its color blocks and generous product photography over heavy typographic hierarchy — the brand feels like a room you want to sit in, not a catalog you scan.

## Components

### Buttons
**`button-primary`** — The primary call-to-action, rendered in the brand's deep navy (#173482) with white text. Used for "Add to Cart", "Shop Now", and primary form submissions. On hover, shifts to a darker navy (`{colors.primary-active}`). Disabled state uses a muted blue (`{colors.primary-disabled}`) with white text. All primary buttons maintain a consistent 48px height and 8px rounded corners.

**`button-secondary`** — A warm alternative CTA using the clay accent (`{colors.accent-clay}`) with dark ink text. Used for "Learn More", "View Details", and secondary actions in hero sections and product cards. Active state deepens to rose (`{colors.accent-rose}`). Height and corner radius match the primary button for visual consistency.

**`button-outline`** — A transparent button with a 2px navy border and navy text. Used for "Save for Later", "Compare", and tertiary actions where a filled button would feel too heavy. Maintains the same 48px height and 8px corner radius as filled variants.

**`button-pill-primary`** and **`button-pill-clay`** — Fully pill-shaped buttons used for badges, tags, and compact actions like "Quick Add" or filter toggles. The pill shape (`{rounded.full}`) distinguishes these from standard CTAs. Used in product cards, category strips, and promotional banners.

### Cards
**`product-card`** — A white card with an 8px rounded corner, no padding at the container level — the image fills the top with `{rounded.sm}` applied to the top corners only. The title uses `{typography.title-sm}` with 16px horizontal padding and 12px top padding. The price sits below in `{typography.body-md}` with 4px top padding and 16px bottom padding. Badges overlay the image area at the top-left corner.

**`product-card-badge`** — A gold (`{colors.accent-gold}`) pill badge with uppercase, 11px bold type. Used for "Best Seller", "New", or "Eco-Friendly" labels. Positioned absolutely over the product image with 8px inset from the top-left.

### Navigation
**`nav-bar`** — A 72px white bar with a soft bottom border (`{colors.hairline-soft}`). Navigation links use 15px weight-600 type with 0.2px letter spacing. The active link is underlined with a 2px navy border. On hover, links shift to navy. The mobile drawer uses the same white background and link styling, stacked vertically.

**`search-bar`** — A fully pill-shaped search input with a 1px hairline border. On focus, the border thickens to 2px and shifts to navy. The placeholder text uses `{colors.muted-soft}`. Height is 48px with 12px vertical and 20px horizontal padding.

### Forms
**`text-input`** — Standard form input with 8px rounded corners, 1px hairline border, and 12px/16px padding. On focus, the border becomes a 2px navy line. Error state uses a 2px red (`{colors.error}`) border. The placeholder is `{colors.muted-soft}`.

**`checkbox`** and **`radio`** — Checkboxes use 4px rounded corners with a 2px hairline border. Checked state fills the background with navy. Radio buttons are fully circular with a 2px hairline border; checked state shows a 6px navy inner circle.

**`toggle`** — A pill-shaped toggle with a hairline gray background. Active state fills with navy. The circular knob is white.

### Footer
**`footer`** — A deep navy (`{colors.primary}`) footer with white text. Links use 14px weight-500 type and shift to sky blue (`{colors.accent-sky}`) on hover. The footer spans the full width with 64px vertical padding and 24px horizontal padding.

### Badges
**`badge-new`** — A marigold (`{colors.accent-marigold}`) pill badge used for new arrivals. Uses uppercase 11px bold type with 3px/8px padding.

**`badge-sale`** — A red (`{colors.error}`) pill badge for sale items. White text on red background.

**`badge-sustainability`** — A sage green (`{colors.accent-sage}`) pill badge for eco-friendly or sustainable products. Dark ink text.

### Accordion
**`accordion`** — A white, 8px rounded container with a 1px soft hairline border. The header uses `{typography.title-sm}`. Expanded state shifts the background to `{colors.surface-soft}`. Used for FAQ sections, product details, and shipping information.

### Tabs
**`tab-active`** and **`tab-inactive`** — Active tabs use a navy fill with white text and 8px rounded corners. Inactive tabs use a soft surface background with muted text. Both use `{typography.button-sm}`.

## Responsive Behavior

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile | < 744px | Single-column product grid, hamburger nav replaces full nav bar, hero section reduces to 32px vertical padding, product cards stack full-width, footer links stack vertically, search bar collapses to icon-only |
| Tablet | 744–1128px | Two-column product grid, nav bar shows 4-5 primary links with hamburger for overflow, hero section uses 48px vertical padding, footer uses 3-column layout |
| Desktop | 1128–1440px | Three-column product grid, full nav bar visible, hero section at full 64px vertical padding, footer uses 4-column layout, search bar full-width in header |
| Wide | > 1440px | Max-width container at 1440px, centered layout with generous margins, four-column product grid, hero section may include full-bleed imagery |

### Touch Targets
- All buttons and interactive elements maintain a minimum 44px height for touch accessibility
- Product card tap targets (title, price, add-to-cart) are spaced at least 8px apart
- Nav links have a minimum 48px tap area on mobile
- Checkbox and radio touch targets are 44px x 44px (includes invisible padding)
- Accordion headers have a minimum 48px tap height

### Collapsing Strategy
- On mobile, the full nav bar collapses to a hamburger menu with a slide-in drawer
- The search bar collapses to a magnifying glass icon that expands to full-width on tap
- Product filters collapse to a "Filter" button that opens a bottom sheet
- The footer's multi-column layout collapses to a single column with accordion-style section headers
- Hero sections reduce vertical padding by 50% on mobile
- Product image galleries switch from horizontal thumbnails to dot indicators

## Known Gaps

- The extracted font list includes "inherit" and "oke-widget-icons" (Okendo review widget), which are not brand fonts — these were excluded from the typography system
- True North Script appears in the extracted fonts but its exact usage context (hero headlines, badges, or decorative elements) could not be confirmed from the extraction alone
- Hover and focus states for many components are inferred from common patterns rather than extracted from the live site
- Error, success, and warning color tokens for form validation were not extracted — only a single red (#b63636) was found
- Dark mode tokens are absent; the brand appears to use a light-only palette
- The exact font weights for Matter and Gooper could not be extracted — weights shown are based on typical usage in similar DTC brands
- Spacing values (padding, margins, gaps) are estimated from common e-commerce patterns rather than extracted from the live site
- The star-rating color (#c1996c) is inferred from the extracted gold accent — actual rating implementation may vary
- The extracted color list includes 30+ colors, many of which may be from third-party widgets (Okendo reviews, Shopify checkout, social icons) rather than the brand's core palette — the primary navy and clay accent were selected as the most distinctive and frequently occurring brand colors
- No animation or transition timing values were extracted
- The brand's Shopify platform is confirmed, but specific theme information was not extracted
