description: A deep, resonant #2d2d2d ink on a warm #fcfbf7 canvas, where the brand's true voltage is carried not by a single accent but by the interplay of three: a cool, precise #0073e5 that reads as engineered clarity, a burnished #d7b87e that recalls aged brass and wood grain, and a restrained #9b1b30 that appears only in select moments of emphasis. The typographic voice is a deliberate mix — Montserrat for clean, modern display weight, Source Sans Pro for readable body copy, and Open Sans Condensed for tight navigation — suggesting a brand that bridges luthier craftsmanship with digital precision. Product imagery dominates over decorative UI; the interface steps back to let the instruments' curves and finishes speak. Corners are mostly sharp ({rounded.none} to {rounded.sm}), with the only softening appearing on media cards and button edges ({rounded.md}), reinforcing a sense of machined exactness. The overall mood is gallery-meets-workshop: generous whitespace, muted secondary surfaces (#f7eddc), and a hierarchy that trusts the photography to do the emotional work while the type system handles information architecture.

## Components

### Buttons
**`button-primary`** — The primary call-to-action, filled with the brand's cool blue {colors.primary} and white text. Used for key actions like "Shop Now", "Learn More", and "Configure". On hover, shifts to {colors.primary-active} for a darker, more grounded state. Disabled state uses {colors.primary-disabled} to signal inactivity without visual noise. The {rounded.sm} corners keep the button feeling precise and engineered, not playful.

**`button-secondary`** — An outlined alternative that sits on the {colors.canvas} background with a 2px {colors.ink} border. Used for secondary actions like "View Details" or "Compare Models". Active state fills the background with {colors.surface-soft} for a subtle pressed effect. The border weight ensures the button remains legible against the warm canvas.

**`button-tertiary-text`** — A text-only button in {colors.primary} with no background or border. Used for inline actions, "Read More" links in product descriptions, and dismissible UI elements. Relies on the {typography.button-md} weight for sufficient presence without a container.

**`button-accent-brass`** — A warm, earthy alternative to the primary blue, using {colors.accent-brass} on a {colors.ink-deep} text. Deployed on product detail pages for "Add to Cart" when the product photography features warm wood tones, or as a secondary CTA in hero sections. The brass hue echoes the physical materials of the instruments.

**`button-accent-red`** — A high-emphasis button reserved for clearance, limited editions, or "Last Chance" urgency. Uses {colors.accent-red} with white text. Appears sparingly — typically only one per page — to preserve its signal value.

### Cards
**`product-card`** — A white card ({colors.surface-card}) with {rounded.md} corners and a 1px {colors.hairline} border. The product image occupies the top with {rounded.md} top corners, while the title, series name, and price sit below in {typography.title-sm} and {typography.body-sm}. On hover, a subtle box-shadow lifts the card 4px off the canvas, suggesting selectability without animation.

**`product-badge-new`** — A small red badge ({colors.accent-red}) with white uppercase text in {typography.badge}. Positioned at the top-left of the product image. The {rounded.sm} corners and tight padding keep it from competing with the product photography.

**`product-badge-sale`** — A brass badge ({colors.accent-brass}) with dark text ({colors.ink-deep}), used for promotional pricing. Same shape and size as the new badge, but the warm metallic tone signals value rather than novelty.

### Navigation
**`nav-bar`** — A fixed top bar at 72px height on {colors.canvas}. Navigation links use {typography.nav-link} (Open Sans Condensed, uppercase, 15px, bold, tracked 0.5px) for a condensed, architectural feel. Active page links shift to {colors.primary}, while hover reveals a {colors.accent-brass} color shift — a subtle nod to the brand's material palette. The bar has a 1px {colors.hairline-soft} bottom border.

**`nav-link-active`** — The current page or section indicator. Uses {colors.primary} with no underline or background change — the color alone signals location.

**`nav-link-hover`** — On hover, links transition to {colors.accent-brass} over 200ms. This brass glow is the brand's signature micro-interaction, echoing the warm metallic hardware on the instruments.

### Forms
**`text-input`** — A standard input field with {colors.canvas} background, 1px {colors.hairline} border, and {rounded.sm} corners. On focus, the border thickens to 2px and shifts to {colors.primary}. Error state uses a 2px {colors.accent-red} border. Height is 44px for comfortable touch targeting. Placeholder text uses {colors.muted}.

### Hero
**`hero-section`** — A full-width dark section using {colors.ink-deep} as background with {colors.canvas} text. Used for flagship product launches and brand storytelling. The {typography.display-xl} headline sits at 42px with generous padding ({spacing.section} top/bottom). A lighter variant (`hero-section-light`) uses {colors.surface-soft} with {colors.ink} text for secondary hero areas.

### Footer
**`footer-section`** — A dark footer on {colors.ink-deep} with {colors.muted-soft} text. Links use {typography.link} and shift to {colors.accent-brass} on hover. The footer is divided into columns with {colors.hairline} dividers between sections. Social icons appear as {icon-button} elements with {rounded.full} shape.

## Responsive Behavior

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile | < 744px | Single-column layout; nav collapses to hamburger; product cards stack vertically; hero text reduces to {typography.display-md}; buttons go full-width; footer columns stack |
| Tablet | 744–1128px | Two-column product grid; nav links remain visible but condensed; hero uses {typography.display-lg}; side-by-side content sections |
| Desktop | 1128–1440px | Three-column product grid; full nav bar with all links; hero at full {typography.display-xl}; multi-column footer |
| Wide | > 1440px | Max-width container at 1440px; product grid can expand to four columns; hero has larger padding; content sections have wider gutters |

### Touch Targets
- All interactive elements (buttons, links, inputs) maintain minimum 44px height
- Icon buttons are 40px × 40px minimum
- Product cards have full-surface tap targets (no small hit areas)
- Nav links have minimum 48px tap height on mobile

### Collapsing Strategy
- Mobile nav collapses to hamburger icon with slide-in drawer
- Product filters collapse to a "Filter" button that opens a modal overlay
- Footer columns stack vertically on mobile
- Hero content stacks (headline above description above CTA) on mobile
- Multi-column product descriptions collapse to single column below 744px

## Known Gaps

- Hover and active states for many components are inferred from common patterns; the live site may use different transitions or color shifts
- Error state styling for forms (validation messages, error icons) was not extractable from the static HTML
- Dropdown menus and mega-nav behavior could not be observed
- Dark mode or high-contrast mode specifications are absent from the extracted data
- The extracted color list contains many framework defaults (WordPress palette colors like #f78da7, #cf2e2e, #ff6900, #fcb900, #7bdcb5, #00d084, #0693e3) that are unlikely to be brand colors — these have been excluded from the palette
- Font weights beyond 400 and 700 were not extractable; intermediate weights (500, 600) are inferred
- Line heights and letter-spacing values are estimated based on common typographic practice, not extracted from CSS
- The brand's true primary accent may be #d7b87e (brass) rather than #0073e5 (blue) — the blue appears more frequently in UI chrome while the brass appears in brand-voice moments; further design review is recommended
- Animation durations, easing curves, and transition properties were not extractable
- Shadow values (box-shadow, drop-shadow) are estimated
- Z-index layering and stacking contexts are unknown
- Print stylesheet behavior is not documented
