description: A monochrome canvas of #f8f8f8 and #232323 where phone cases become architectural objects rather than accessories — the brand treats its product photography with the same deadpan precision as a Scandinavian furniture catalog, letting matte black polycarbonate and microfiber lining speak through negative space. The extracted palette is overwhelmingly achromatic: #232323 anchors the system as the ink for every headline and primary CTA, while #f8f8f8 provides a warm, almost paper-like canvas that softens what could be a cold minimalism. The single chromatic voltage comes from #0e2cc7, a saturated royal blue that appears on sale badges, delivery-promise highlights, and the occasional accent link — it’s used so sparingly that when it appears it feels like a deliberate interruption. Futura PT runs across the system in two weights (book and medium), a geometric sans that echoes the brand’s mid-century modern sensibility; there are no rounded corners on the product itself, but the UI uses {rounded.sm} for buttons and {rounded.md} for cards, creating a subtle distinction between the hard-edged product and the soft interface that frames it. The checkout flow introduces #31862d (a muted green for “in stock” indicators) and #dd4242 (error states), but these feel inherited from Shopify’s defaults rather than brand decisions. The overall effect is a storefront that trusts its product photography to carry the emotional weight — the UI is deliberately recessive, a gallery wall painted #f8f8f8 where the phone cases are the art.

## Components

### Buttons
**`button-primary`** — The primary call-to-action across the site, rendered as a solid #232323 rectangle with uppercase Futura PT Medium at 14px. On hover, the background shifts to #111111 with no scale or shadow animation — the brand prefers a flat, no-fuss interaction. The disabled state uses #bfbfbf for background, maintaining the same dimensions and typography but removing all interactivity cues. **`button-secondary`** — An inverted variant with #f8f8f8 background and #232323 text, used on dark hero sections or footer areas where the primary button would blend into the canvas. **`button-secondary-outline`** — A transparent background with a 1px #232323 border, used for “Add to Cart” on product detail pages and secondary actions in modals. **`button-accent-blue`** — Reserved for promotional CTAs and limited-edition drops, using #0e2cc7 as the background to create visual urgency against the otherwise monochrome palette.

### Cards
**`product-card`** — A clean, borderless card on #f8f8f8 canvas with {rounded.md} corners applied only to the image container. The card contains a product image on #f4f4f4 background, a title in {typography.title-md}, and a price in {typography.price}. Sale items display a **`product-card-sale-badge`** — a small #0e2cc7 rectangle with white uppercase text, positioned at the top-left of the image. In-stock indicators use **`product-card-stock-badge`** with #31862d background. The rating component uses #fcc13c for star icons, rendered at 12px.

### Navigation
**`nav-bar`** — A fixed top bar at 64px height on #f8f8f8, containing the brand logo (left), navigation links in uppercase 13px Futura PT Medium with 0.5px letter-spacing (center), and utility icons (search, cart, account) on the right. On scroll, the bar compresses to 56px. The mobile hamburger menu icon uses a 40px {rounded.full} touch target. **`nav-link`** — Uppercase 13px Futura PT Medium with no underline decoration; the active page is indicated by a 2px #232323 underline bar beneath the text.

### Forms
**`text-input`** — A 48px tall input on #f8f8f8 canvas with 1px #dedede border and {rounded.sm} corners. Focus state shifts the border to #232323. Error state uses #dd4242 border and text color for the error message below the field. The placeholder text is #bfbfbf. **`quantity-selector`** — A compact 40px tall component with minus/plus buttons flanking a centered numeric value, used on cart and product detail pages.

### Footer
**`footer-section`** — A full-width #232323 block with white text, containing column headings in {typography.title-md} and links in {typography.link}. The footer uses no background image or pattern — the brand maintains its minimal ethos even in the deepest part of the page. Social media icons render in white at 20px with 40px {rounded.full} touch targets. **`footer-link`** — White 14px Futura PT Book with no underline; hover adds a subtle opacity shift to 0.8.

### Notifications & Messages
**`notification-bar`** — A 36px tall banner across the top of the page (below the nav) using #0e2cc7 background, used for shipping promotions, sale announcements, and cookie consent. The text is white 13px Futura PT Book. **`error-message`** — A #dd4242 background pill with white text, used for form validation and checkout errors. **`success-message`** — A #31862d background pill with white text, used for “Added to Cart” confirmations and successful form submissions.

### Dividers
**`divider`** — A 1px #dedede horizontal rule used between sections and product rows. **`divider-soft`** — A 1px #dcdcdc variant used within cards and accordion panels for a subtler separation.

## Responsive Behavior

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile | < 744px | Single-column product grid; nav collapses to hamburger; hero text reduces to {typography.display-lg}; product cards stack vertically; footer links collapse into accordion; search bar becomes full-width below nav |
| Tablet | 744–1128px | Two-column product grid; nav links remain visible but reduce letter-spacing; hero maintains {typography.display-xl} with reduced padding; footer shows two columns |
| Desktop | 1128–1440px | Three-column product grid; full nav with all links; hero uses maximum padding; footer shows four columns; product cards show hover state with subtle shadow |
| Wide | > 1440px | Four-column product grid; content max-width at 1440px with centered layout; hero uses larger typography scale; product cards gain additional whitespace |

### Touch Targets
- All interactive elements (buttons, links, icons) maintain minimum 44px height
- Icon buttons use 40px {rounded.full} circles for finger-friendly taps
- Quantity selector buttons are 40px × 40px minimum
- Mobile nav hamburger icon is 44px × 44px
- Product card tap targets extend to full card width

### Collapsing Strategy
- Primary navigation collapses to hamburger menu below 744px
- Footer link columns collapse to single accordion below 744px
- Product grid reduces from 4 columns to 1 column on mobile
- Hero section reduces padding from 64px to 32px on mobile
- Search bar transitions from inline to full-width below 744px
- Product image galleries switch from row to single-image swipe on mobile

## Known Gaps

- Hover and focus states for most components could not be reliably extracted from the static HTML; the above assumes minimal opacity/border changes based on common patterns
- Error state styling for select dropdowns and checkboxes was not observed
- The brand may use additional Futura PT weights (light, bold) that were not present in the extracted font declarations
- Dark mode styling is not present on the live site and was not documented
- Sub-brand or collection-specific color palettes (e.g., limited edition drops) were not captured
- Animation durations and easing curves for transitions (button hover, card hover, nav scroll) were not extractable
- The exact border width for `button-secondary-outline` is assumed at 1px based on visual inspection
- Checkout-specific styling (Shopify checkout override colors) was not extracted and may differ from the main site palette
- The extracted #fcc13c (star-rating) and #ffcc00 (accent-yellow) may be Shopify default colors rather than intentional brand choices
- Product card shadow on hover was not extractable and is assumed to be a subtle box-shadow based on common e-commerce patterns
