description: A restrained, material-first home office brand that uses a single electric violet accent (#4500ff) to punctuate an otherwise monochrome palette of near-blacks (#1a1a1a, #222222, #1d1d1d) and warm off-whites (#fafafa, #f9fafb, #f3f4f6). The violet appears only on primary CTAs, interactive elements, and the brand's signature desk-organizer badge — a deliberate scarcity that makes every click feel like a deliberate action. Surfaces are treated with soft rounding (`{rounded.sm}` ~8px) on cards and `{rounded.md}` ~12px on product images, while buttons use a tighter `{rounded.sm}` that reads as precise rather than playful. The typography stack relies on Muli (a geometric sans-serif with humanist warmth) at moderate weights — body copy at 400, headings at 600–700 — avoiding the extreme thinness or heaviness that would compete with the wood-grain textures that are the brand's true visual hero. A secondary teal (#108474) surfaces in sustainability badges and eco-claims, while a muted marigold (#fbcd0a) provides occasional star-rating or highlight punctuation. The checkout experience pulls in Shopify's default blues (#2463ec, #007aff), which clash slightly with the brand violet — a known tension between platform constraints and brand identity. The overall effect is of a workshop catalog rendered in clean digital: the wood stays warm, the interface stays cool, and the violet is the only voice that asks for your attention.

## Components

### Buttons
**`button-primary`** — The brand's primary call-to-action, rendered in the signature violet (#4500ff) with white text and `{rounded.sm}` corners. On hover, it deepens to `{colors.primary-active}` (#3a00d9); when disabled, it fades to `{colors.primary-disabled}` (#b399ff). The `{typography.button-lg}` at 16px/600 weight gives it a confident, slightly elevated presence against the mostly neutral page.

**`button-secondary`** — An outlined variant on white canvas with `{colors.ink}` text, used for secondary actions like "Learn More" or "Add to Wishlist." Shares the same `{rounded.sm}` and height as the primary button but uses a 1px `{colors.hairline}` border to maintain visual hierarchy without competing with the violet.

**`button-tertiary`** — A text-only link styled as a button, using `{colors.primary}` for the text and no background. Appears in contexts where the action is supplementary but still brand-significant, such as "View Details" links within product cards.

**`button-pill-primary`** — A compact pill-shaped variant (`{rounded.full}`) at 40px height, used for filter tags, category navigation, and mobile CTAs where space is tight. The `{typography.button-md}` at 14px keeps it readable without overwhelming the surrounding content.

**`button-pill-outline`** — The outlined counterpart to the pill primary, used for inactive filter states and secondary mobile actions. The transparent background and `{colors.ink}` text allow it to sit comfortably on both white and soft gray surfaces.

### Cards
**`product-card`** — The core product display unit, a white card with `{rounded.md}` (12px) corners and a 1:1 aspect ratio product image. The image itself inherits the same rounding, creating a clean, contained visual. Below the image, the title uses `{typography.title-md}` at 18px/600 weight, and the price uses `{typography.price}` at 16px/600 weight. A `{spacing.md}` (12px) gap separates the image from the text block.

**`product-card-badge`** — A small, uppercase badge in `{colors.badge-new}` (violet) that appears on new arrivals or featured products. The `{rounded.xs}` (4px) and tight padding (4px 8px) keep it unobtrusive but legible.

**`product-card-badge-eco`** — A sustainability badge in `{colors.badge-eco}` (teal #108474), used to flag products made from certified materials or with eco-friendly manufacturing. Same dimensions as the new-arrival badge but distinct in color to signal a different kind of value.

### Navigation
**`nav-bar`** — A fixed-height (72px) white navigation bar with `{colors.ink}` text links set in `{typography.nav-link}` (15px/600 weight). The active link state uses a 2px solid underline in `{colors.primary}`, providing a clear but restrained indicator of the current section. The bar remains white across all pages, relying on the violet accent only for the active state.

**`nav-link-active`** — The active navigation state, distinguished by the violet underline rather than a background fill or bold weight change. This keeps the nav bar visually calm while still providing clear wayfinding.

### Forms
**`text-input`** — A standard text input on white canvas with `{rounded.sm}` (8px) corners and `{typography.body-md}` at 16px. On focus, it gains a 2px `{colors.primary}` border, replacing the default `{colors.hairline}`. The 48px height matches the primary button, ensuring form fields and CTAs align vertically in checkout flows.

**`select-input`** — A dropdown variant of the text input, sharing the same dimensions, rounding, and focus behavior. Used for quantity selectors, sort options, and filter dropdowns on collection pages.

### Hero & Search
**`hero-section`** — The primary brand storytelling area, using the white canvas as a backdrop for large product photography or lifestyle imagery. The heading uses `{typography.display-xl}` at 32px/700 weight with a `maxWidth` of 600px to prevent line-length issues on wide screens. The subheading sits below in `{typography.body-lg}` at 17px/400 weight in `{colors.muted}` (#6f6f6f), with a 500px max width.

**`search-bar`** — A pill-shaped search input (`{rounded.full}`) at 48px height, used on collection pages and the mobile navigation drawer. The `{typography.body-md}` placeholder text reads as approachable, and the full rounding differentiates it from the more angular form inputs.

### Footer
**`footer`** — A dark footer on `{colors.ink}` (#1a1a1a) with white text, providing a clear visual boundary at the bottom of every page. Links use `{colors.muted-soft}` (#7b7b7b) to reduce visual weight, while section headings use `{typography.title-md}` in white for hierarchy. The `{spacing.section}` (64px) vertical padding gives the footer generous breathing room.

### Badges
**`badge-sustainability`** — A pill-shaped badge in teal (#108474) with white uppercase text, used to flag eco-certified products and sustainability claims. The `{rounded.full}` shape and 6px 12px padding make it feel like a tag rather than a button, reinforcing its informational role.

**`star-rating`** — A 5-star rating display using `{colors.star-fill}` (marigold #fbcd0a) for filled stars and `{colors.star-empty}` (#e5e5e5) for empty ones. Each star is 16px, and the component is used on product cards and review summaries.

## Responsive Behavior

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile | < 744px | Nav bar collapses to hamburger menu; product cards go to single column; hero section reduces heading to 24px; search bar moves to sticky bottom; footer stacks vertically. |
| Tablet | 744–1128px | Nav bar shows 4–5 links; product cards in 2-column grid; hero heading at 28px; search bar in nav bar. |
| Desktop | 1128–1440px | Full nav bar with all links; product cards in 3-column grid; hero heading at 32px; search bar in nav bar. |
| Wide | > 1440px | Max content width of 1440px with centered layout; product cards in 4-column grid; hero section has larger photography. |

### Touch Targets
- All interactive elements (buttons, links, inputs) maintain a minimum 44px height for touch accessibility.
- Icon buttons are 40x40px, exceeding the 44px target in one dimension.
- Product card tap targets (title, price, image) are grouped into a single touch zone to prevent mis-taps.
- Filter pills are 40px tall with 24px horizontal padding, providing ample tap area.

### Collapsing Strategy
- On mobile, the nav bar collapses to a hamburger icon that opens a full-screen overlay drawer with all links and the search bar.
- The product grid collapses from 4 columns (wide) to 3 (desktop) to 2 (tablet) to 1 (mobile).
- The footer collapses from a multi-column layout to a single vertical stack on mobile, with accordion-style expandable sections for link groups.
- The hero section collapses its side-by-side image/text layout to a stacked layout on tablet and mobile, with the image above the text.

## Known Gaps

- The extracted font list includes "JudgemeStar" (a review-widget icon font), "graphie" (likely a misspelling or internal name), and "swiper-icons" (a carousel library) — the primary brand font is inferred as Muli based on frequency and context, but the exact font stack (including fallbacks) is an educated reconstruction.
- Hover and focus states for secondary buttons, text inputs, and links are inferred from common patterns rather than extracted from the live site.
- The exact border radius for product cards (12px) is estimated from the extracted color frequencies and typical Shopify theme patterns; the actual value may vary by 2–4px.
- Error styling for form inputs (red borders, error message typography) is not present in the extracted data.
- Dark mode is not supported by the brand's current site; all extracted colors assume a light theme.
- The teal (#108474) and marigold (#fbcd0a) accent colors are present in the extracted list but their exact usage contexts (badges, ratings, eco-labels) are inferred from common e-commerce patterns rather than confirmed.
- The Shopify checkout overlay colors (#2463ec, #007aff) are platform defaults and may not reflect intentional brand choices — they are excluded from the core palette but noted here as a known tension.
- The brand's wood-grain and material textures are not captured in the extracted data; these are visual elements that would need to be sourced separately.
