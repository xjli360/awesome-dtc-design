description: A cookbook specialist’s library, where the warmth of a well-stocked kitchen shelf is translated into a digital storefront through a buttery canvas of #fffbf2 and a gilded accent of #ab8c52 that reads like aged brass or the spine of a vintage Le Cordon Bleu manual. The brand’s primary color, #ab8c52, appears on key interactive elements — the add-to-cart button, the search icon, and the footer’s newsletter signup — lending a sense of permanence and quality that resists the throwaway feel of generic e-commerce. Typography is set in Figtree for body and Fraunces for display, a pairing that balances Fraunces’s soft, ink-trap serifs (used for book titles and section headers at 24–32px) with Figtree’s clean, slightly condensed sans-serif for product descriptions and navigation. The site’s secondary palette is restrained: #222222 for ink, #444444 for body text, and #747474 for muted labels, all resting on the warm #fffbf2 canvas. Cards and surfaces use #ffffff for contrast, with hairline borders in #dedede and softer dividers in #eaeaea. A subtle #e7d2aa appears as a hover state on secondary buttons and as a background tint on featured collections, echoing the color of unbleached parchment. The overall mood is that of a serious but welcoming bibliophile’s corner — no aggressive sales tactics, just a quiet confidence in the curation. Signature design moves include a full-width hero section featuring a single cookbook cover at 60% of the viewport height, a persistent top nav with a search bar that expands on click, and a product grid that uses generous whitespace (48px between rows) to let each cover breathe. The checkout flow, while standard Shopify, is overlaid with the brand’s #fffbf2 canvas and #ab8c52 accents, avoiding the generic blue of default Shopify themes. The result is a site that feels less like a store and more like a personal recommendation from a trusted food historian.

## Components

### Buttons
**`button-primary`** — The primary call-to-action, used for "Add to Cart," "Checkout," and "Subscribe." Rendered in the brand's gilded #ab8c52 with white text and a soft 8px radius. On hover, it deepens to #8e6f3a (`{colors.primary-active}`) with no shadow — the brand avoids heavy elevation in favor of color shift. The disabled state fades to #d4c49a (`{colors.primary-disabled}`), maintaining readability but signaling inactivity. Height is 44px, a comfortable touch target that doesn't overwhelm the product grid.

**`button-secondary`** — Used for "View Details," "Continue Shopping," and secondary form actions. A white button with a 1px #dedede border and ink text. On hover, the background shifts to #e7d2aa (`{colors.surface-featured}`) and the border to #ab8c52, creating a subtle parchment effect that echoes the brand's warm canvas. Active state uses the same hover treatment but with a slightly thicker border.

**`button-tertiary-text`** — A text-only link styled as a button, used for "Learn More" and "Read Reviews." Rendered in #ab8c52 with no background or border, matching the brand's link color. Padding is minimal (8px vertical, 0 horizontal) to keep the text flush with surrounding content. Hover state adds an underline.

### Cards
**`product-card`** — The core product display unit, a white card with a 12px radius and no border — the card relies on the #fffbf2 canvas for separation rather than a hard stroke. The image occupies the top portion with rounded top corners (`{rounded.md} {rounded.md} 0 0`), while the title and price sit below with 8px horizontal padding. On hover, a subtle box-shadow lifts the card 4px, creating a gentle stacking effect. The price is always rendered in #ab8c52, reinforcing the brand's accent as a signal of value.

**`featured-collection`** — A highlighted section for curated book lists (e.g., "Staff Picks," "New Arrivals"). The background is #e7d2aa (`{colors.surface-featured}`), a warm parchment tone that contrasts with the white product cards placed inside. Padding is 32px horizontal and 24px vertical, with a 12px radius. The section header uses `{typography.display-md}` in Fraunces to distinguish it from standard product rows.

### Navigation
**`nav-bar`** — A fixed top bar at 72px height, using the #fffbf2 canvas with a subtle bottom border in #eaeaea. Navigation links are set in Figtree at 15px weight 500, with the active page underlined by a 2px #ab8c52 bar. The search icon sits on the right, expanding into a pill-shaped input on click (`{rounded.full}`). On mobile, the nav collapses into a hamburger menu with a full-screen overlay.

**`nav-link`** — Individual navigation items with 8px vertical and 16px horizontal padding. Inactive links use #222222, while the active link shifts to #ab8c52 with a bottom border. Hover state uses a subtle opacity shift to #444444.

### Forms
**`text-input`** — Standard form input for checkout fields and account forms. A white background with a 1px #dedede border and 12px radius. On focus, the border thickens to 2px and switches to #ab8c52, with no outline — the brand uses border-color and thickness as the sole focus indicator. Height is 48px with 12px vertical padding for comfortable typing.

**`search-bar`** — A pill-shaped input (`{rounded.full}`) used in the nav and on the search page. At rest, it's 44px tall with a 1px #dedede border. On focus or expansion, it grows to 48px with a 2px #ab8c52 border, signaling active input. The placeholder text uses #b9b9b9 (`{colors.muted-soft}`).

**`newsletter-input`** and **`newsletter-button`** — A paired input and button in the footer. The input is 40px tall with a 1px #dedede border and 8px radius, while the button uses the primary #ab8c52 at the same height. The two elements sit side-by-side with no gap, creating a seamless join.

### Footer
**`footer`** — A dark footer in #222222 with white text and links in #b9b9b9. The newsletter signup is the primary interactive element, with the input in white and the button in #ab8c52. Links use `{typography.link}` at 14px weight 500, with hover states shifting to #ffffff. The footer is padded 48px vertically and uses a 64px section spacing above it.

### Badges
**`badge`** — Used for "NEW" labels on recently added books. Rendered in #d32f2f with white text, 4px radius, and 2px vertical / 8px horizontal padding. The type is uppercase Figtree at 11px weight 700 with 0.5px letter-spacing.

**`badge-sale`** — Used for discounted items. Rendered in #9acd32 with #222222 text, maintaining the same dimensions and typography as the standard badge. The green tone is the brand's only bright accent, used sparingly.

## Responsive Behavior

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile | < 744px | Nav collapses to hamburger; product grid goes single-column (1 card per row); hero image reduces to 40vh; search bar becomes a full-width input below the nav; footer stacks vertically |
| Tablet | 744–1128px | Nav links remain visible but condensed; product grid uses 2 columns; hero image at 50vh; search bar remains pill-shaped but narrower |
| Desktop | 1128–1440px | Full nav with all links; product grid uses 3 columns; hero image at 60vh; search bar in nav expands on click |
| Wide | > 1440px | Max-width container at 1440px with centered content; product grid uses 4 columns; hero image at 60vh with wider margins |

### Touch Targets
- All buttons and interactive elements are minimum 44px height (48px for primary inputs) to meet WCAG touch target guidelines.
- Nav links have 16px horizontal padding, ensuring a comfortable tap area even on dense nav bars.
- Product card images are tappable as links, with the entire card surface acting as a click target (no small "View" buttons).
- Search bar expands to 48px height on focus, providing a larger tap area for text input.

### Collapsing Strategy
- On mobile (< 744px), the top nav collapses into a hamburger icon that opens a full-screen overlay menu. The search bar moves below the nav as a standalone full-width input.
- The product grid collapses from 3 columns (desktop) to 2 columns (tablet) to 1 column (mobile), with cards stacking vertically.
- The hero section reduces its image height from 60vh to 40vh on mobile, with text overlay adjusting to a single-column layout.
- The footer collapses from a multi-column layout (desktop) to a single vertical stack on mobile, with the newsletter signup remaining at the top of the stack.
- Featured collection sections maintain their background color but reduce horizontal padding from 32px to 16px on mobile.

## Known Gaps

- **Hover states for product cards**: The extracted data shows a box-shadow on hover, but the exact shadow values (spread, color opacity) could not be reliably determined. Assumed 0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.08) based on common patterns.
- **Error and validation styling**: The extracted list includes #d32f2f (likely error red) and #9acd32 (likely success green), but their exact usage in form validation (border colors, icon placement, message typography) is inferred, not extracted.
- **Dark mode**: No evidence of a dark mode variant. The brand's warm canvas (#fffbf2) is likely the only mode.
- **Sub-brand or seasonal palettes**: The site may use different accent colors for special collections (e.g., holiday themes), but these were not captured in the extraction.
- **Loading states**: Skeleton screens, spinner styles, and loading animation details are absent from the extraction.
- **Focus-visible styles**: While focus states are inferred for text inputs (2px primary border), other interactive elements (buttons, links) may have additional focus-visible outlines not captured.
- **Checkout flow**: The Shopify checkout may override some brand colors (e.g., payment button colors from Shopify Pay, Klarna, Afterpay). The extracted list includes #d32f2f and #9acd32 which may be checkout-widget colors rather than brand colors — these are noted as potential false positives.
- **Font weights for Fraunces**: The exact font weights used (e.g., 600 vs 700 for display) are inferred from common usage; the extraction only confirmed the font family name.
- **Spacing values for specific components**: While global spacing tokens are defined, component-specific padding and margin values (e.g., product card internal padding) are estimated based on visual analysis of the extracted colors and layout patterns.
