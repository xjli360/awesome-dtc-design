description: A dark, weather-bitten canvas for outdoor equipment, where #1c1b1b ink swallows most of the screen and #4469af — a cold, alpine blue — cuts through as the single primary voltage. The site reads like a field notebook: body text in Open Sans at 16px sits on #f2f2f2 surface-soft panels, while #363636 muted text and #d9d9d9 hairline strokes keep hierarchy crisp without shouting. Product imagery dominates — the brand trusts full-bleed hero shots of tents and packs against #121212 backgrounds, letting gear speak over copy. Buttons carry {rounded.sm} corners and the primary blue (#4469af) flips to #c8232c (a sharp red) for sale badges and urgency markers, a two-tone system that feels like trail signage. The typography stack leans on Unica77LLWeb-Regular for display — a clean, Swiss-inspired sans that avoids outdoor-brand cliché — with monospace for technical specs. There is no gradient, no glassmorphism, no decorative flourish; every pixel earns its place through utility. The footer collapses into a single column of #a1a1a1 links on #1c1b1b, and the cart drawer uses #ff2626 for remove actions, a red that matches the urgency of a forgotten stove. This is a system built for people who read weather reports and pack by weight — not for browsing.

## Components

### Buttons
**`button-primary`** — The primary call-to-action across the site, used for "Add to Cart", "Checkout", and primary form submissions. Renders as a solid #4469af rectangle with white uppercase text at 14px/600 weight. On hover, shifts to #286ef8; disabled state drops to #a1a1a1. All variants share {rounded.sm} and 44px height.

**`button-secondary`** — Outline variant for secondary actions like "View Details" or "Continue Shopping". White background with a 2px #1c1b1b border and matching ink text. Active state fills to #f2f2f2 surface-soft. Maintains the same 44px height and uppercase typography as primary.

**`button-danger`** — Destructive action button for cart removals and account deletions. Uses #ff2626 fill with white text, matching the urgency red found in cart remove links. Shares same dimensions and typography as primary.

### Cards
**`product-card`** — The core product display unit, a white card with {rounded.md} corners and no border — relies on shadow from surrounding layout. Contains a full-width product image with top-rounded corners, a title in 16px/600 Open Sans, and a price in 16px/400 body weight. Sale items overlay a {colors.sale-badge} badge in the top-left corner.

### Navigation
**`nav-bar`** — Fixed top navigation at 72px height with a white background and a single #d9d9d9 hairline bottom border. Links render in 14px/600 uppercase Open Sans. On scroll, gains a subtle box-shadow. The logo sits left-aligned; primary nav links center; utility links (search, cart, account) right-align.

**`search-bar`** — A pill-shaped input with {rounded.full} and a 1px #d9d9d9 border. On focus, the border thickens to 2px and shifts to #4469af. Uses 16px body text for query entry. Sits in the nav bar on desktop; expands to full-width on mobile.

### Forms
**`text-input`** — Standard form input with white background, 1px #d9d9d9 border, and {rounded.sm} corners. Focus state swaps to a 2px #4469af border. Error state uses a 2px #ff2626 border. Height is 48px with 12px/16px padding for comfortable touch targets.

### Footer
**`footer`** — Full-width dark section on #1c1b1b background with #a1a1a1 link text. Links hover to white. Content stacks in a single column on mobile, multi-column on desktop. Includes social icons in #00aced with hover shift to #4fc3f7.

### Badges & Tags
**`sale-badge`** — Small #c8232c rectangle with white uppercase 11px/700 text, {rounded.xs} corners, and 2px/8px padding. Overlaid on product card images for sale items. The red matches the urgency accent found in cart remove actions.

## Responsive Behavior

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile | < 744px | Single-column product grid; nav collapses to hamburger; footer stacks vertically; search bar expands full-width below nav; hero text reduces to 24px |
| Tablet | 744–1128px | Two-column product grid; nav links visible but condensed; footer splits into two columns; hero maintains 36px display |
| Desktop | 1128–1440px | Three-column product grid; full nav with all links; footer in four columns; hero at full height with 36px display |
| Wide | > 1440px | Max-width container at 1440px; product grid can show four columns; hero scales proportionally |

### Touch Targets
- All buttons and interactive elements minimum 44px height (WCAG AAA compliant)
- Text inputs at 48px height for comfortable touch entry
- Nav links have minimum 44px tap area even when text is smaller
- Cart quantity selectors at 36px height — borderline, but consistent with compact cart layout
- Social icons at 24px with 44px tap padding

### Collapsing Strategy
- Primary navigation collapses to hamburger menu below 744px
- Product grid reduces from 3 columns to 2 at tablet, 1 at mobile
- Footer column count drops from 4 to 2 at tablet, 1 at mobile
- Hero overlay text reduces font size below 744px
- Search bar moves from nav bar to full-width below nav on mobile
- Accordion-style product details replace tabbed layout below 744px

## Known Gaps

- Hover and focus states for all components were inferred from common patterns; extracted CSS may not reflect exact brand implementations
- Error state styling for forms (colors, icons, messaging) was not reliably extracted from the live site
- Dark mode preferences or alternate color schemes were not detected
- Sub-brand or seasonal color palettes (e.g., limited edition collections) are not represented
- Animation durations, easing curves, and transition properties were not extracted
- The extracted hex list includes many grays and blues that may be Shopify defaults or stock image tones — the true brand palette may be narrower than listed
- Specific font weights for Unica77LLWeb-Regular beyond 400 were not confirmed; all display text assumes weight 400
- Product card shadow depth and spread values were not extractable from static CSS
- Checkout flow styling (Shopify checkout override) was not analyzed
- Mobile navigation drawer animation and overlay behavior were not captured
- The #c62828 and #cb2b2b reds in the extracted list may be alternate sale/danger variants but their usage context is unclear
- #e4c4c4 and #c0c0c0 may be legacy or unused colors — included in extraction but not assigned to components
