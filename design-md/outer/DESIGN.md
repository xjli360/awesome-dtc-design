name: Outer
description: Outer is an outdoor furniture brand that reimagines the backyard as an extension of the home, not a separate, less comfortable space. The brand's visual language is anchored in a deep, confident navy (`#223843`) that reads as both premium and grounded — it appears on primary navigation, key CTAs, and footer backgrounds, creating a consistent frame of reliability. Against this, a crisp white canvas (`#ffffff`) keeps the product photography and lifestyle imagery breathing, while a soft silver-grey (`#dedede`) appears in hairline borders and subtle dividers, echoing the aluminum and steel frames of the furniture itself. The accent palette introduces a vibrant sky blue (`#1990c6`) and a deeper oceanic teal (`#136f99`) that appear in hover states, secondary badges, and promotional highlights — these blues feel organic to the outdoor setting, not arbitrary brand decoration. A near-black (`#121212`) provides high-contrast body text for readability in bright sunlight, and a system blue (`#007aff`) handles standard link and interactive affordances. Typography runs Barlow, a geometric sans-serif with warm, open apertures that balance modernity with approachability — display sizes sit at moderate weights (500–600) rather than heavy 700+, letting the furniture's silhouette and material texture carry the visual weight. The system uses generous `{rounded.sm}` (8px) on cards and buttons — soft enough to feel friendly, not so pill-shaped that it undermines the clean, architectural lines of the product. Spacing is generous: `{spacing.section}` (64px) separates major content blocks, while `{spacing.lg}` (24px) and `{spacing.xl}` (32px) create comfortable breathing room around product grids and feature panels. The overall effect is a brand that feels like a well-edited outdoor room — intentional, uncluttered, and quietly luxurious, where every design decision serves the goal of making the outdoors feel as livable as indoors.

## Components

### Buttons
**`button-primary`** — The primary call-to-action across the site. Uses the brand's deep navy (`#223843`) with white text, 8px rounded corners, and 48px height. On hover, it shifts to `#1a2d36` for a subtle darkening effect. The disabled state uses a muted grey-blue (`#a0b4bd`) to signal unavailability without visual noise. Padding of 14px top/bottom and 32px left/right gives it a substantial, confident presence.

**`button-secondary`** — An outlined variant with a white background and navy text, framed by a 2px solid navy border. Used for secondary actions like "Learn More" or "View Details." Hover state fills the background with the soft surface tone (`#f5f6f7`) and darkens the border to `#1a2d36`. Same height and rounded corners as primary for visual consistency.

**`button-tertiary-text`** — A text-only button with no background or border. Uses navy text at 15px/600 weight. Appears in contexts where a minimal interaction is needed, such as "Cancel" in forms or "See All" in content strips.

**`button-pill-accent`** — A pill-shaped button using the accent blue (`#1990c6`) for promotional or highlight CTAs. Full rounded corners, smaller padding (10px 24px), and smaller typography (13px/600). Used for limited-time offers, new collection announcements, or seasonal campaigns.

### Cards
**`product-card`** — The primary product display unit. A white card with 8px rounded corners, no padding on the container (padding is handled by child elements). The image area occupies a 4:3 aspect ratio with rounded top corners only. Content area receives 16px horizontal padding and 24px bottom padding. The title uses 16px/600 weight in ink, while the price appears in 16px/600 weight in navy to draw attention.

**`product-card-badge`** — A small, soft badge overlaid on product images or within card content. Uses a light blue background (`#e6f4fb`) with accent blue text (`#1990c6`), 4px rounded corners, and uppercase 11px/600 typography. Used for "New," "Best Seller," or "Eco-Friendly" labels.

### Navigation
**`top-nav`** — A fixed-position navigation bar at 72px height with white background and a subtle bottom border (`#e8e8e8`). Navigation links use 14px/500 weight, uppercase with 0.5px letter spacing. Active links appear in navy, inactive in muted grey. The nav houses the logo, main category links, search icon, and cart icon.

**`nav-link-active`** and **`nav-link-inactive`** — Define the two states for top navigation items. Active links use the primary navy to indicate current page or section. Inactive links use the muted grey (`#6b7b84`) to recede visually. Both share the same typography for consistent alignment.

### Forms
**`text-input`** — Standard text input fields with white background, 1px hairline border (`#dedede`), 8px rounded corners, and 48px height. On focus, the border thickens to 2px and shifts to accent blue (`#1990c6`). Error state uses a red border (`#d32f2f`). Padding of 12px top/bottom and 16px left/right provides comfortable cursor placement.

**`search-bar`** — A slightly differentiated input for search functionality. Uses a soft background (`#f5f6f7`) instead of white, with the same rounded corners and height as text inputs. On focus, it transitions to white background with a 2px accent blue border, signaling active search mode.

### Footer
**`footer`** — A full-width footer with navy background (`#223843`) and white text. Contains columns for customer support, company info, product categories, and social links. Links appear at 80% opacity, increasing to full opacity on hover. Section padding of 64px top/bottom and 32px left/right creates a substantial closing statement for each page.

### Badges
**`badge-new`** — A pill-shaped badge using accent blue (`#1990c6`) with white text. Used to flag newly launched products or collections. The full rounded shape and uppercase 11px/600 typography make it distinct from the softer product-card badge.

**`badge-sale`** — A red pill badge (`#d32f2f`) for sale or clearance items. Same shape and typography as the new badge but with urgency-inducing red. Used sparingly to maintain impact.

### Dividers
**`divider`** — A full-width horizontal line at 1px height using the standard hairline color (`#dedede`). Used between major sections or content blocks.

**`divider-soft`** — A lighter version using `#e8e8e8` for subtler separation within cards or between related content items.

## Responsive Behavior

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile | < 744px | Single-column product grid, hamburger navigation, reduced hero padding (32px), stacked footer columns, smaller display typography (display-xl drops to 32px) |
| Tablet | 744–1128px | Two-column product grid, expanded navigation with dropdowns, hero padding at 48px, two-column footer, display-xl at 40px |
| Desktop | 1128–1440px | Three-column product grid, full top-nav visible, hero at full section padding (64px), four-column footer, full display-xl at 48px |
| Wide | > 1440px | Max-width container at 1440px centered, four-column product grid, extended hero with larger imagery, all typography at maximum sizes |

### Touch Targets
- All interactive elements (buttons, links, inputs) maintain minimum 44x44px touch targets on mobile
- Product card tap targets extend to full card area, not just text
- Navigation hamburger icon is 48x48px for easy thumb access
- Cart and search icons in top nav are 44x44px minimum
- Form inputs maintain 48px height for comfortable touch interaction

### Collapsing Strategy
- Top navigation collapses to hamburger menu at < 744px, with full-height overlay drawer
- Product grid collapses from 4 columns (wide) to 3 (desktop) to 2 (tablet) to 1 (mobile)
- Footer columns collapse from 4 (desktop) to 2 (tablet) to stacked single column (mobile)
- Hero section reduces vertical padding from 64px to 32px on mobile, with text centered instead of left-aligned
- Product card images switch from 4:3 to 1:1 aspect ratio on mobile for better vertical scrolling
- Search bar collapses to icon-only on mobile, expanding to full-width overlay on tap

## Known Gaps

- Hover states for product cards (shadow elevation, scale, or border change) could not be reliably extracted from static CSS
- Error styling for form validation (error messages, iconography, animation) is inferred from common patterns but not confirmed
- Dark mode palette is not present on the live site — all extracted colors assume light mode
- Sub-brand or collection-specific palettes (e.g., "Coastal," "Modern," "Rustic") may exist but were not detected
- Loading states, skeleton screens, and spinner animations are not documented
- Focus ring styles (outline, offset, color) for keyboard accessibility are not confirmed
- Modal and overlay patterns (sizing, animation, scrim opacity) are inferred from common practice
- Toast/notification component styling is absent from extracted data
- Dropdown menu styling (shadow, z-index, animation) for navigation sub-menus is not captured
- Quantity selector and variant picker (color swatches, size options) styling details are missing
- Mobile bottom navigation or tab bar patterns are not present in extracted data
- Checkbox and radio button custom styling is not documented
- Tooltip and popover component specifications are absent
- Print stylesheet behavior is unknown
