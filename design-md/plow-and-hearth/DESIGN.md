description: Orange embers pressed against parchment — the CTA flame of #ff6600 lands against warm cream (#f7f1e1) with the same logic as a lit lantern at garden-dusk: functional heat that reads as comfort rather than urgency. The palette divides cleanly into two registers. A cool utility layer of near-whites and light grays (#f7f7f7, #f9f9f9, #fafafa) keeps the product catalog airy and scannable; a warm heritage layer — cream (#f7f1e1), sand-tan (#c9ad90), forest green (#2a5135), and that campfire orange — carries the homestead identity the brand name promises. The deep navy (#0f172a) anchors footers and utility bars, a shade that arrives looking like wood-smoke charcoal rather than tech neutral because the surrounding warmth earns it.

  Typography pairs editorial serif with functional sans-serif: Source Serif Pro and Apple Garamond carry headings with a colonial-ledger authority — the kind of type that sells heirloom tomato seeds and cast-iron planters through print catalogs and has only recently moved online. Nunito Sans and canada-type-gibson handle navigation, labels, and body copy at lighter weights, keeping the reading experience clean without erasing the brand's analog roots. Display headings at 48px in a 600-weight serif feel like a trusted seed catalog; they invite browsing, not scanning.

  Buttons use {rounded.sm} at 8px — groundedness over friendliness. There is no pill shape anywhere on the site, which suits a brand whose products have physical weight and dimensions. Product cards carry a hairline border and a soft shadow on hover rather than color fills, letting the photography dominate. Forest green (#2a5135) surfaces as a secondary CTA color and badge accent, anchoring the garden identity without painting every surface in it. The promo strip below the nav runs in that same green — a constant environmental cue that this is a place for living things and outdoor spaces.

## Components

### Buttons
**`button-primary`** — Fires in #ff6600 with uppercase canada-type-gibson via `{typography.button-md}` and a contained 12px 28px pad inside a 48px tall body. The {rounded.sm} corner at 8px is deliberately unambitious — this brand sells objects with physical weight, and a pill shape would feel out of register. Active drops to #ff580d, keeping the ember-orange family; disabled washes to #ffc299 rather than a generic gray, preserving hue identity even in the inactive state.

**`button-secondary`** — White fill with a {colors.hairline-strong} perimeter border at #cececd, same height and type as primary. Holds back visually so the orange can lead; on active the border tightens to full {colors.ink} and the background lifts to {colors.surface-soft}.

**`button-green`** — Forest green (#2a5135) variant for garden-category CTAs, add-to-cart alternatives in seasonal promotions, and email sign-up confirmations. Same padding and uppercase treatment as primary, but the cooler temperature signals "nature and quality" rather than "buy now."

### Product Card
**`product-card`** — {colors.surface-card} fill with a 1px {colors.hairline} border and no rounded excess beyond {rounded.xs}. Hover triggers a 0 4px 16px shadow lift rather than a color wash, keeping the product image central. Title in {typography.title-sm} (canada-type-gibson 600) floats above a {typography.price-sm} price line; sale badges pin absolute top-left in {colors.primary} orange with uppercase {typography.sale-tag}, new-arrival badges in {colors.forest-green}. This two-badge system handles the full promotional vocabulary without additional color tokens.

### Navigation
**`nav-bar`** / **`nav-bar-top-strip`** — Two-tier structure: the 32px top strip in {colors.nav-dark} carries shipping thresholds, phone numbers, and account links in {typography.caption-sm} white on near-black. The main 64px bar below it holds the logo center-left, mega-menu categories in {typography.nav-link}, and utility icons (search, account, cart) right-aligned. Category dropdowns use wide panels with {colors.surface-soft} backgrounds and image-supported subcategory blocks — consistent with the catalog browsing rhythm the brand's heritage implies.

### Hero Banner
**`hero-banner`** — Full-width, minimum 480px. The default warm-cream ({colors.surface-warm} #f7f1e1) background hosts lifestyle photography and a {typography.display-xl} headline in Source Serif Pro — serif at this size reads as inviting editorial rather than corporate declaration. A dark variant (`hero-banner-dark`) in {colors.nav-dark} covers seasonal sale events where urgency overrides warmth. All hero CTAs use `button-primary`; a secondary text link in {colors.accent-blue} may appear beneath for "Shop All" escapes.

### Promotional Banner
**`promo-banner`** — Full-width strip in {colors.forest-green} pinned directly below the navigation, carrying sitewide threshold messages ("Free shipping on orders over $XX") in white {typography.body-sm} at font-weight 600, center-aligned. The green-on-green pairing with the `button-green` CTA style creates a coherent environmental layer across the page header. On mobile this strip converts to a dismissible toast-style banner so it doesn't consume too much of the 375px viewport.

### Search
**`search-bar`** — Inline within the main nav bar at 44px height, {rounded.xs} corners. A magnifier icon in {colors.muted} sits at the left edge; the input grows on focus with a border shift from {colors.hairline} to {colors.ink}. On mobile, search collapses to a magnifier icon tap target (minimum 44×44px) that expands to a full-width overlay input covering the nav.

### Badges
**`sale-badge`** / **`new-badge`** — Both are 3px 8px padded chips with {rounded.xs} corners and uppercase {typography.sale-tag}. Orange for sale, forest green for new — the two most frequent promotional signals the brand runs, covered without inventing additional palette entries.

### Footer
**`footer`** — Deep {colors.nav-dark} (#0f172a) with {colors.surface-tan} (#c9ad90) link text: warm sand on near-black evokes parchment-on-dark-wood, positioning the footer as a reference section rather than a legal afterthought. Column headings in {typography.title-sm}, body links in {typography.body-sm}. Four columns on desktop: Customer Care, About Us, Garden & Outdoor, and a newsletter sign-up column. Social icons and payment badges sit at the base below a {colors.slate-mid} divider line.

### Breadcrumb
**`breadcrumb`** — Compact {typography.caption} with {colors.muted} links, "/" separator in {colors.hairline-strong}, and the current page segment in {colors.ink} at the same size. Sits below the nav bar on category and product detail pages. No interactive treatment on the final segment.

## Responsive Behavior

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile | < 744px | Single-column product grid; hamburger drawer nav replacing mega-menu; promo-banner converts to dismissible toast; hero image stacks above copy block; search expands to full-width overlay |
| Tablet | 744–1128px | Two-column product grid; top utility strip collapses to a single centered message; hero switches to 50/50 image-text split |
| Desktop | 1128–1440px | Three-to-four column product grid; full two-tier nav with mega-menu dropdowns; hero spans full width with constrained copy column |
| Wide | > 1440px | Layout max-width ~1440px centered; hero photography fills edge-to-edge with copy column constrained to ~600px; product grid stays at four columns |

### Touch Targets
- All primary and secondary buttons minimum 48px height, 120px minimum width
- Mobile nav drawer links minimum 44px tap height with {spacing.base} vertical padding
- Cart, search, and account icons minimum 44×44px hit area with padding compensation
- Pagination buttons 36px height, minimum 36px width, {spacing.sm} gap between items
- Badge chips are display-only — no minimum tap requirement unless used as filter toggles

### Collapsing Strategy
- Top utility strip collapses first at tablet breakpoint; single centered shipping message replaces multi-item row
- Category mega-menu collapses to an accordion inside a slide-out drawer on mobile; first level visible by default, subcategories expand on tap
- Footer four-column grid collapses to two columns at tablet, then single-column accordion with collapsed sections on mobile
- Product card secondary metadata (item number, SKU count) hides below 744px to reduce visual noise per card
- Promo banner text truncates to a single headline at mobile; any secondary CTA link becomes an expand trigger

## Known Gaps

- No meta theme-color extracted; mobile browser chrome color is unspecified
- Exact licensed weights for canada-type-gibson (light, book, medium, bold) were not confirmed from extracted CSS; weight assignments inferred from typical usage
- No explicit border-radius values were captured from the live site; {rounded.sm} 8px reflects Shopify theme defaults and may differ from the actual implementation
- Hover and focus state colors for body links and form inputs were not directly observed; derived from palette logic
- Mega-menu panel layout, column count, and image block dimensions were not extracted
- Mobile drawer animation timing and easing curve are unconfirmed
- No brand icon set was identified; likely standard Shopify theme SVG icons or a licensed set not detectable via color extraction
- The serif/sans split at specific heading levels is inferred from the font-family stacks; live CSS cascade hierarchy was not fully mapped
- Exact spacing values used within product cards and category grids were not measured from the live site
