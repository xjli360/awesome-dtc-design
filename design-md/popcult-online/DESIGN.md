name: PopCult Online
description: The deepest near-black (#040404) stretched across the canvas signals immediately that PopCult Online is a destination for dedicated collectors rather than a casual retail browse — this is the visual register of a specialty floor where a chase variant Funko commands the same weight as a headline. Against that ground, a collector-grade red (#cc3b3b) fires through CTAs, sale badges, and price highlights with an intensity that reads as limited-edition urgency rather than generic retail alarm. Its darker sibling (#bd0000) handles hover and active states, tightening the chromatic voltage without breaking internal logic — the two reds form a narrow range that rewards closer inspection. Poppins and Rubik share the typographic stage: Rubik's slightly rounded geometry at heavier weights anchors display headings with a confidence that suits shelves lined with licensed character figures, while Poppins handles body copy and UI labels with approachable geometric legibility that pop culture fans — who range from teenage newcomers to thirty-year completionists — can scan at a glance. Neither font reaches for editorial formality; both lean toward the bold-but-friendly register that Funko's own visual identity occupies. The near-blacks are varied and layered: #111111 anchors the main canvas, #1e1e1e lifts card surfaces one tier, and #272727 provides a third stop for hover states and interactive wells. This three-stop dark stack creates spatial depth without introducing hue — product cards appear to float above the page rather than sit flush. The muted rose (#e99292) handles disabled and secondary accent states, and #aaaaaa carries metadata like SKU labels and availability text. Rounded corners read as restrained — `{rounded.sm}` to `{rounded.md}` is the operative range; the brand doesn't reach for pill shapes except in filter chips and the search input, keeping the layout feeling structured and catalogue-like over a grid that may display dozens of items per row.

## Components

### Buttons

**`button-primary`** — The primary action button renders in collector red (#cc3b3b) with white Poppins semi-bold type at 14px and 0.3px tracking. On hover it deepens to #bd0000, communicating add-to-cart and checkout urgency without animation overhead. Disabled state uses the muted rose (#e99292) at half opacity, preserving chromatic identity even when the action is unavailable.

**`button-secondary`** — A hairline-bordered ghost button with dark surface and white type, used for wishlisting, sharing, and filter-adjacent actions. The 1px border in #272727 is subtle on the dark canvas, making it read as a secondary affordance without visual competition against the primary red.

**`button-ghost`** — Transparent background with primary-red text, used for inline "View All" tails on category rows and see-more expansions where a full button would over-weight the UI.

### Search

**`search-input`** — A slightly elevated surface (#1e1e1e) container with `{rounded.md}` corners and a leading icon in muted gray (#aaaaaa). No floating label animation — placeholder disappears on focus immediately. Used both in the nav bar (icon-triggered expansion on mobile) and as a visible inline field on desktop.

### Navigation

**`nav-bar`** — Fixed to the deepest canvas (#040404) to create a hard visual anchor at the top of the viewport, perceptually darker than the page body beneath it. Nav links render in Poppins 500 at 14px in near-white (#fafafa). A 1px hairline in #272727 provides a floor separation from the content layer. Cart icon and logo occupy the rightmost and leftmost positions respectively.

### Product Cards

**`product-card`** — The core grid unit. Cards sit on a mid-dark surface (#272727) with an image zone backed by the slightly softer #1e1e1e, creating a recessed box that frames product photography. Product name renders in Poppins 600 at 14px; price renders in Rubik 700 at 18px — the numerical weight carries collection-value signal at a glance. A subtle shadow (0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.4)) lifts cards off the canvas. On hover, the shadow deepens and the card translates 2px upward — a light float that signals selection intent without full-scale animation.

### Badges

**`badge-sale`** — Red (#cc3b3b) fill anchored to the top-left corner of the product image, uppercase Poppins 700 at 11px with 0.5px tracking. Reads as sale urgency at thumbnail scale. **`badge-exclusive`** — Inverted treatment: deep canvas-black (#040404) fill with primary-red text and a 1px red border, marking chase variants and site-exclusives — the outlined style reads as special-edition rather than on-sale. **`badge-new`** — Neutral dark surface (#1e1e1e) with white type for recently listed items that carry no pricing urgency.

### Category Filters

**`category-pill`** — Soft dark surface pill with light body text (#eeeeee), rendered in a horizontal scroll row above product grids for IP filtering (Marvel, Disney, DC, etc.). Active state fills to primary red with white type — a binary toggle that's scannable at speed. Minimum height 36px ensures touch accessibility in the horizontal strip.

### Hero Banner

**`hero-banner`** — Full-width section on the deepest canvas (#040404) with a display headline in Rubik 700 at 40px. The accent red appears in headline highlights or keyword spans rather than as a background fill, preventing the hero from reading as an alert state. Body copy in Poppins 400 at 15px and a primary button below form a clean three-layer structure: headline → context → action.

### Price Display

**`price-regular`** — Rubik 700 at 18px in near-white (#fafafa), carrying list-price weight on product cards and PDPs. **`price-sale-display`** — Same typeface and size but rendered in primary red (#cc3b3b) for the markdown price, with the original struck through in muted gray (#aaaaaa). The red/gray contrast makes the discount immediately legible against the dark card surface without requiring a separate badge.

### Footer

**`footer`** — Deep-black canvas (#040404) with a top hairline in #272727 separating it from the product grid above. Column navigation links render in Poppins 400 at 13px in light body color (#eeeeee); legal and policy links step down to muted gray (#aaaaaa). Vertical padding uses `{spacing.xxl}` above and below.

## Responsive Behavior

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile | < 744px | Single-column product grid; nav collapses to hamburger + logo + cart icon; category pills convert to horizontal scroll strip; search field hides behind icon tap; hero headline scales to `display-md` |
| Tablet | 744–1128px | Two- to three-column product grid; main nav links revealed inline alongside logo; search input visible inline rather than icon-only |
| Desktop | 1128–1440px | Four-column product grid; full nav with all category labels and potential dropdown menus; breadcrumb visible; hero at full `display-xl` |
| Wide | > 1440px | Grid stays at four columns; container max-width constrains layout with expanding side gutters to preserve readability |

### Touch Targets
- All product cards are full-tap zones; no inner link disambiguation needed on mobile
- Primary and secondary buttons maintain 44px height at all breakpoints
- Category pills maintain 36px minimum height in horizontal scroll row
- Cart, hamburger, and search icons each hold a minimum 44×44px hit area

### Collapsing Strategy
- Navigation collapses to a left-slide drawer on < 744px, overlaying a dark scrim over the canvas
- Category filter row converts to a horizontally scrollable chip strip on mobile with hidden scrollbar
- Search transitions from inline nav field to full-width bar below the nav bar on mobile tap
- Footer column grid (4-up on desktop) collapses to single-column accordion-style stack on mobile

## Known Gaps

- Logo mark shape, dimensions, and exact treatment not extractable from color/font data
- Top-level navigation category count and dropdown depth unknown
- Whether product images use white, transparent, or dark backgrounds could not be confirmed — `{colors.surface-soft}` used as a safe card image background assumption
- Exact gutter widths and column counts at each breakpoint are estimates based on typical Funko-store grid conventions
- Wishlist, quick-view, and variant-selector interaction patterns not observable from extraction
- Animation easing and transition timing values not captured
- Whether the site uses a sticky/fixed nav or scrolls away with the page is unknown
- Dark/light mode toggle presence or absence not confirmed
