description: A performance-gaming brand that signals its precision through a high-voltage blue (#3561ff) — the meta theme-color and the single electric accent that charges every primary button, link, and badge across a near-monochrome canvas of deep charcoal (#232527, #1c1d1f) and cool white (#fafdff). The brand lives in a world of soft surfaces: cards and buttons carry gentle radii ({rounded.sm}–{rounded.md}), while the typography runs Outfit at clean weights — display heads sit at 500–600 rather than the aggressive 700+ common in gaming, suggesting a mature, tool-like confidence. A secondary accent of vivid cyan (#1dfef2) and a warning yellow (#ffd900) appear sparingly, reserved for stock indicators and sale flags. The extracted palette reveals a heavy reliance on near-blacks (#252525, #121212) and cool grays (#e9ecee, #d3d7d9, #8d9398) that frame product photography — mice, keyboards, and accessories — as the hero. The brand's voice is technical but not cold: the blue (#3561ff) is the same shade used in engineering schematics and precision instruments, and the layout leans on generous whitespace and centered product grids rather than dense, information-heavy modules. The single most distinctive design move is the pairing of a bright, saturated primary with a near-black body — a high-contrast system that reads as both premium and functional, closer to tool design than esports spectacle.

## Components

### Buttons
**`button-primary`** — The primary call-to-action across the site, filled with the brand's electric blue (#3561ff) and white text. Used for "Add to Cart", "Pre-Order", and primary checkout flows. On hover, shifts to a deeper blue (#2b6ae0). Disabled state uses a muted blue (#899df1) with reduced opacity feel.

**`button-secondary`** — A white-filled button with dark text for secondary actions like "View Details" or "Learn More". The outline variant uses a transparent background with a dark border, maintaining the same 44px height and {rounded.sm} corners for visual consistency.

**`button-ghost`** — A text-only button with no background, using the primary blue for text color. Used for "Cancel", "Clear Filters", and inline actions where a full button would be too heavy.

**`button-pill-primary`** — A compact, fully rounded variant of the primary button, used for filter tags, category pills, and small CTAs. The pill shape ({rounded.full}) distinguishes it from the standard {rounded.sm} primary button.

### Cards
**`product-card`** — The core product display unit, a white card with {rounded.md} corners containing a product image, title, price, and optional badges. The image area uses the same corner radius, creating a clean, contained visual. Cards sit on a soft gray surface (#f6f6f6) or white canvas, with consistent spacing between grid items.

**`product-card-badge`** — Small, uppercase labels overlaid on product images. Yellow (#ffd900) for sale items, cyan (#1dfef2) for new arrivals, purple (#8500ff) for pre-orders. Each uses {rounded.xs} and tight padding to sit unobtrusively in the top-left corner of the product image.

### Navigation
**`nav-bar`** — A fixed 64px header on white background, containing the logo, product category links in uppercase Outfit 500, a search icon, and a cart icon. Active nav links use the primary blue; inactive links use muted gray (#8d9398). On scroll, a subtle hairline (#dedede) appears at the bottom.

**`nav-link-active` / `nav-link-inactive`** — Uppercase navigation links with 0.2px letter spacing. Active state uses primary blue (#3561ff) with no underline or background — the color alone signals the current section.

### Forms
**`text-input`** — Standard input fields with white background, dark text, and {rounded.sm} corners. Focus state adds a primary blue border. Error state uses red (#ff3939) for the border and text. Height is consistent at 44px to match button height for aligned form rows.

**`quantity-selector`** — A compact input group for adjusting product quantities, with minus/plus buttons flanking a centered number. Uses {rounded.sm} and matches the 40px height of icon buttons for inline alignment.

### Search
**`search-bar`** — A fully rounded search input ({rounded.full}) with a magnifying glass icon, placeholder text, and a 48px height. Used in the mobile menu and on search-focused pages. The pill shape distinguishes it from standard text inputs and signals a more casual, exploratory interaction.

### Footer
**`footer`** — A dark section using the brand's near-black (#232527) as background with white text. Links use the muted gray (#d3d7d9) for a softer contrast. The footer contains columns for product categories, support links, and social icons, with generous padding ({spacing.section}) top and bottom.

### Badges
**`badge-new`** — Cyan (#1dfef2) background with dark text, used to flag newly released products. The high-contrast cyan stands out against both white and dark surfaces, creating a "fresh" visual signal.

**`badge-sale`** — Yellow (#ffd900) background with dark text, used for discounted items. The warm yellow creates urgency without the aggression of red.

**`badge-preorder`** — Purple (#8500ff) background with white text, used for upcoming products available for pre-order. The purple sits between the primary blue and accent cyan in the brand's accent hierarchy.

## Responsive Behavior

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile | < 744px | Single-column product grid, hamburger menu replaces top nav, search bar collapses to icon, footer stacks vertically, hero section reduces padding to {spacing.xl} |
| Tablet | 744–1128px | Two-column product grid, top nav shows limited links with "More" dropdown, search bar remains full-width in header, footer displays two-column layout |
| Desktop | 1128–1440px | Three-column product grid, full top nav with all category links, search bar integrated into header, footer shows four-column layout |
| Wide | > 1440px | Four-column product grid, max-width container (1440px) centers content, hero section uses larger display-xl type, additional whitespace around product cards |

### Touch Targets
- All buttons and interactive elements maintain minimum 44px height for touch accessibility
- Icon buttons use 40px diameter circles with 24px icons inside
- Nav links have 48px tap targets (padding extends beyond text)
- Product card CTAs are full-width on mobile for easy tapping

### Collapsing Strategy
- Top nav collapses to hamburger menu below 744px
- Product grid reduces from 4 columns to 1 column on mobile
- Footer collapses from 4 columns to stacked single column below 744px
- Hero section reduces type size from display-xl to display-lg on tablet, display-md on mobile
- Search bar collapses to icon-only trigger on mobile, expanding to full-width overlay on tap

## Known Gaps

- Hover and focus states for most components were inferred from the extracted palette; actual transition durations and shadow values are unknown
- Error state styling (red #ff3939) was extracted but form validation patterns (success states, helper text, character counts) are not documented
- The extracted color list includes many near-blacks and grays that may represent Shopify theme defaults rather than intentional brand choices — the true brand palette may be more limited
- Dark mode styling is not present in the extracted data; the brand may not support it
- Typography scale (font sizes, weights, line heights) was estimated from the single extracted font-family (Outfit) and common gaming-brand patterns; actual values may differ
- Component spacing (padding, margins) was inferred from common e-commerce patterns and may not match the live site exactly
- The accent colors (cyan #1dfef2, yellow #ffd900, purple #8500ff) were extracted but their exact usage contexts (which badge types, hover states, etc.) are speculative
- No animation or transition timing data was extracted
- The brand's icon system (cart, search, hamburger, social icons) is not documented — only the container styles are captured
- Product card hover states (elevation, border changes) are unknown
- The checkout flow uses Shopify's default styling, which may differ from the brand's design system
