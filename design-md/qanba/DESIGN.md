description: A fighting-game hardware brand that announces itself in high-contrast red and black — #dd1111 as the primary voltage, a saturated, almost aggressive crimson that appears on every product badge, add-to-cart button, and sale flag, set against a deep #222222 ink background that gives the storefront the weight of a tournament-grade arcade stick. The palette is deliberately limited: #dd1111 for action, #222222 for structure, #f5f5f5 and #f7f7f7 for the canvas, and a single accent of #ff6600 that surfaces on limited-edition or high-margin items. Typography runs GothamBook-Regular at display sizes and OpenSans-Regular for body copy, both sans-serif faces that read clean and utilitarian — no serif flourishes, no decorative weight, just the functional legibility of a control panel label. Product cards use a soft {rounded.sm} corner on thumbnails and a {rounded.md} on the card container itself, while the primary CTA button takes a {rounded.sm} that feels purposeful without being soft. The nav bar is a solid band of #222222 with white text, and the footer repeats the same dark mass with muted #888888 links. There is no hero imagery, no lifestyle photography — the site leads with product grids, spec tables, and compatibility badges, treating the hardware as its own best visual. The overall mood is that of a pro-gear catalog: direct, high-contrast, and built for people who already know what they want.

## Components

### Buttons
**`button-primary`** — The primary call-to-action across the site, used for "Add to Cart", "Buy Now", and primary checkout flows. Rendered in #dd1111 with white text, 4px corner radius, and 44px height. On hover, shifts to #cc0000. Disabled state uses #e4e4e4 background with #aaaaaa text, signaling the button is non-interactive.
**`button-secondary`** — An outlined or ghost alternative for secondary actions like "View Details" or "Learn More". Uses white background with #222222 text, same 44px height and 4px corner radius as primary. Hover adds a thin #222222 border.
**`button-accent-sale`** — Reserved for limited-time offers and clearance items. Uses #ff6600 background to visually distinguish from the standard red primary. Same dimensions and corner radius as `button-primary`.
**`button-pill`** — A compact, fully rounded variant used for filter tags, category pills, and small inline actions. Uses `{typography.button-sm}` at 12px bold, 8px vertical padding, and 20px horizontal padding.

### Navigation
**`top-nav`** — A full-width 60px bar in #222222 containing the brand logo on the left and navigation links on the right. Links use `{typography.nav-link}` at 14px semibold with 0.5px letter spacing. The active link state shifts text color to #dd1111.
**`nav-link`** — Individual navigation items with 8px 16px padding. Default color is white, active state is #dd1111. No background on hover — the brand relies on color change alone for feedback.

### Cards
**`product-card`** — The primary product display unit, a white card with 8px corner radius and 16px padding. Contains a product image with 4px corner radius, a title in `{typography.title-sm}`, and a price in `{typography.price}` at 18px bold. Badges overlay the top-left of the image area.
**`product-card-image`** — The image container within a product card, using #f5f5f5 as a placeholder background and 4px corner radius. Images are typically square or 4:3 ratio.

### Badges
**`badge-sale`** — An orange (#ff6600) badge with white text, 2px 8px padding, and 2px corner radius. Used to flag discounted items. Text is 11px bold.
**`badge-new`** — A blue (#005ab0) badge with white text, same dimensions as `badge-sale`. Used for newly released products.
**`badge-compatibility`** — A neutral badge in #f7f7f7 with #555555 text, 4px 12px padding, and 4px corner radius. Used to display platform compatibility (e.g., "PS5", "PC", "Xbox") on product cards.

### Forms
**`text-input`** — Standard text input field for search, newsletter signup, and form fields. White background, 44px height, 4px corner radius, 10px 16px padding. Focus state adds a 2px #dd1111 border.
**`search-bar`** — A compact 40px search input used in the top nav or mobile menu. Same styling as `text-input` but reduced height.

### Footer
**`footer-section`** — A full-width dark band in #222222 with 48px vertical padding. Contains columns of links and brand information. Text defaults to #aaaaaa, with headings in white.
**`footer-link`** — Footer navigation links in #aaaaaa at 14px regular weight. Hover shifts to white.
**`footer-heading`** — Column headings in the footer, rendered in white at 16px semibold.

### Hero
**`hero-banner`** — A full-width promotional banner in #222222 with white text. Uses `{typography.display-lg}` at 28px. Typically contains a headline, optional subtitle, and a `hero-cta` button. Padding is 64px vertical, 24px horizontal.
**`hero-cta`** — The primary call-to-action within a hero banner. Same styling as `button-primary` but with 14px 32px padding for a more prominent appearance.

## Responsive Behavior

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile | < 744px | Single-column product grid; nav collapses to hamburger menu; hero padding reduced to 32px vertical; product cards stack full-width; footer columns stack vertically |
| Tablet | 744–1128px | Two-column product grid; nav links remain visible but compact; hero maintains 48px vertical padding; search bar moves to nav overlay |
| Desktop | 1128–1440px | Three-column product grid; full nav with all links visible; standard hero padding; search bar visible in nav |
| Wide | > 1440px | Four-column product grid; max-width container at 1440px; hero content centered with max-width 1200px |

### Touch Targets
- All buttons and links maintain minimum 44px height for touch accessibility
- Product card tap targets (title, price, image) are each at least 48px tall
- Nav links have 44px minimum tap area despite 14px text
- Badge tap targets are wrapped in larger parent containers for accessibility

### Collapsing Strategy
- Product grid collapses from 4 columns (wide) to 3 (desktop) to 2 (tablet) to 1 (mobile)
- Top nav collapses to hamburger menu at < 744px; the menu overlay contains all nav links plus search
- Footer columns collapse from 4 columns (desktop) to 2 (tablet) to 1 (mobile)
- Hero banner reduces vertical padding by 50% on mobile; CTA button remains full-width below headline

## Known Gaps

- Hover and focus states for most components could not be reliably extracted from the live site; the values above (e.g., `button-primary-active`) are inferred from the extracted palette and common patterns
- Error state styling (form validation, out-of-stock messaging) was not observed; `error` and `error-soft` colors are extracted but their usage is speculative
- Dark mode is not supported; the site uses a light canvas (#f5f5f5) with dark nav/footer sections
- Sub-brand or limited-edition color palettes (e.g., special edition arcade sticks) were not captured
- The extracted font list includes multiple variants of OpenSans and GothamBook, but exact usage per component (e.g., which weight for which heading level) is inferred from common patterns
- Animation and transition timing values were not extracted
- The extracted hex list is heavily weighted toward grays and reds; the brand's true primary (#dd1111) is the most distinctive color in the set, but the palette may include additional accent colors not present in the extraction
- Shopify Pay, Klarna, and other checkout-widget colors may be present in the extracted list but were not isolated
