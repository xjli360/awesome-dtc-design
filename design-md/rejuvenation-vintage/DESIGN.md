description: Antique brass (#896b27) does the work that most retail brands assign to a hero gradient — every primary CTA, price callout, and hover accent draws from the same oxidized-metal tone, placing the digital storefront in direct conversation with the cast-iron and hand-rubbed finishes it actually sells. The base palette is a period typographer's choice: near-black charcoal (#1a1818, #2b3033) borrowed from the ink of pre-war hardware catalogues, against which the brass reads warm and deliberate rather than decorative. A brick-red (#d04727) surfaces on urgent callouts and editorial accent headers, recalling the kiln-fired tones of Arts & Crafts tilework — a rare appearance that keeps it from reading as a generic clearance flag. Type runs in Gotham, a geometric American grotesque that wears surprisingly well against 1910–1940 hardware forms; its even stroke widths and closed apertures feel less Silicon Valley than they do WPA-era civic signage. Display sizes lean heavy at 36–48px/700 to anchor editorial category headers, while body copy settles at 16px/400 for unhurried browsing of condition notes and provenance details. Corner radii are minimal throughout — product cards at {rounded.xs}, input fields at {rounded.sm}, and only pill-shaped filter chips use {rounded.full} — a restraint that suits a shop where the goods predate modern consumer interface design by a century. Silver-gray (#b9babb) handles hairlines and secondary text, the visual equivalent of aged patina on a white-ground label. The overall system reads more like a museum catalogue than a trend-driven marketplace: deliberate, unhurried, and grounded in the authority of objects with documented histories.

## Components

### Buttons
**`button-primary`** — Brass-gold (#896b27) fill with uppercase Gotham at 14px/600, tracked 0.5px, on {rounded.xs} corners that read period-appropriate rather than modern-soft. Active state deepens to #6e5420; disabled fades to {colors.primary-disabled}. The uppercase treatment is intentional: it echoes the label typography on pre-war hardware bins and catalogue index cards, tying the action to the product aesthetic rather than generic SaaS button conventions.

**`button-secondary`** — White canvas with a 1.5px charcoal ({colors.body}) border and matching uppercase type; used for secondary actions such as "Save to List" or "Compare." On hover, background warms to {colors.surface-soft} and the border tightens to {colors.ink}, signaling interactivity without introducing a color that would compete with the brass primary.

**`button-brick`** — Brick-red (#d04727) fill, same corner and type treatment as `button-primary`. Reserved for editorial urgency — promotional callouts, time-limited availability, or clearance section headers. Its rarity in the layout preserves its signal strength; overuse collapses it to visual noise.

**`filter-chip`** — The only {rounded.full} component in the system. Inactive chips carry a hairline border on white; active chips invert fully to {colors.ink} fill with {colors.on-dark} text. Used for faceted browsing by era, finish, material, or price range. The pill shape contrasts deliberately against the square-cornered product grid, visually grouping filter state as a separate interactive layer.

### Product Card
**`product-card`** — Portrait-ratio (4:5) image flush to the card edge above a compact metadata strip: item name in {typography.title-sm}, price in {typography.price-display}, and a one-line condition or era note in {typography.caption} warm gray. Cards use {rounded.xs} with a {colors.hairline-soft} border that firms and gains a 4px drop shadow on hover. Badge overlays (`badge-new`, `badge-sale`, `badge-estate`) sit flush top-left with zero radius — pressed hard against the image corner like a real price sticker, not floated softly over the photo.

### Navigation
**`nav-bar`** — 64px white bar with a {colors.hairline-soft} bottom rule; navigation labels in {typography.nav-link} track at 0.3px for legibility at small sizes. Active category underlines with a 2px {colors.primary} stroke, maintaining the brass-as-primary-signal convention. The custom `rejuvenation-icons` icon font handles category glyphs throughout; no SVG sprites.

### Hero
**`hero-banner`** — Full-bleed on {colors.body} charcoal with editorial photography, {typography.display-xl} title, and a {typography.body-md} subtitle. Minimum 480px tall on desktop. A single `button-primary` CTA floats against the dark field, where brass reads luminous without a competing highlight — the dark ground amplifies the metallic primary in a way a white field cannot.

### Badges
Zero-radius badge tokens are a deliberate period reference — price tags on vintage hardware don't have rounded corners. Brass ({colors.badge-new}) signals new arrivals; brick-red ({colors.badge-sale}) signals sale or clearance; near-black ({colors.ink}) signals curated estate provenance. All three use {typography.badge-text} at 10px/700/tracked 1px uppercase, sized to sit legibly on a product image without obscuring subject matter.

### Footer
**`footer`** — Near-black (#1a1818) field with on-dark type, {colors.hairline} gray links that warm to {colors.primary} brass on hover. Column headers in {typography.label-uppercase} (11px, tracked 1.2px) are the footer's most formally strict typographic moment: no ornamentation, just spaced columns and a warm hover state that echoes the CTA brass without confusing section labels for buttons.

### Filter Sidebar
**`filter-sidebar`** — 240px fixed-width panel, label headers in {typography.label-uppercase}, option rows in {typography.body-sm}, separated from the product grid by a {colors.hairline-soft} right border. A brass-colored checkbox check mark signals selection state without introducing a new surface color.

### Condition Labels
**`condition-label`** — Provenance and grading notes in {typography.caption} with a 2px {colors.primary} left border rule. This small component signals archival care: the brass stripe marks a curatorial annotation rather than a marketing claim, consistent with how labels appear in auction catalogues.

## Responsive Behavior

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile | < 744px | Single-column product grid; filter sidebar becomes bottom-sheet drawer triggered by a filter button with applied-count badge; nav collapses to hamburger; hero min-height drops to 320px with reduced {spacing.lg} padding |
| Tablet | 744–1128px | Two-column product grid; filter sidebar toggles as an overlay panel; top nav shows primary categories with overflow into a "More" dropdown |
| Desktop | 1128–1440px | Three-column product grid with persistent 240px filter sidebar; full nav bar with hover-activated category mega-menus |
| Wide | > 1440px | Four-column product grid; content max-width caps at 1440px with symmetric side gutters; hero text stack gains additional leading space |

### Touch Targets
- All buttons minimum 44px height on mobile
- Filter chips minimum 36px height tap target
- Nav links minimum 44px tap area with full-row hit region
- Product cards use full-card tap affordance, not image-only

### Collapsing Strategy
- Filter sidebar collapses to a labeled sheet with applied-filter count badge on mobile
- Category sub-navigation collapses to a horizontally scrollable strip pinned below the main nav on tablet
- Hero reflows to {typography.display-md} scale on mobile with {spacing.lg} vertical padding
- Breadcrumb truncates to parent + current page on mobile; full path visible from tablet up
- Condition-label left-border rule is preserved at all breakpoints as a key visual signal

## Known Gaps

- No meta theme-color extracted; mobile browser chrome color is undetermined
- Gotham weight variants (Book, Medium, Bold) not confirmed from extraction; specific weights inferred from typical Rejuvenation brand usage patterns
- Product-card image aspect ratio not verified from live grid extraction; 4:5 inferred from catalog photography conventions
- Hover and focus state animation durations and easing curves not extracted
- No confirmed dark-mode palette; all tokens assume light-mode only
- Custom `rejuvenation-icons` glyph set not catalogued; icon names and codepoints unknown
- Surface-soft (#f5f2ed) and surface-warm (#ede8e0) warm-white values are aesthetic inferences, not directly extracted from the live site
- Promotional banner treatment beyond badge-level (color, height, placement) not confirmed
- The page extraction returned an error page rather than a live product grid, so component spacing measurements could not be verified against rendered layout
