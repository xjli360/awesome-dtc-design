name: Revival Rugs
description: Revival Rugs is a brand that feels like a well-loved heirloom — intentional, warm, and grounded in craft. The palette is anchored by a deep, almost ink-like navy (`#1f3041`) that appears on primary buttons, navigation bars, and key typographic moments, lending a sense of quiet confidence. This is balanced by a rich, earthy terracotta (`#b04e2d`) that surfaces in secondary accents, badges, and hover states — a nod to the natural dyes and handwoven textures of the rugs themselves. The canvas is a soft, off-white parchment (`#fcfaf5`) that avoids the sterility of pure white, while a slightly warmer surface (`#ece8e0`) is used for cards and soft UI containers. Typography leans on a mix of Inconsolata for monospaced, editorial moments and P22UndergroundBook for body text, with P22UndergroundHeavy reserved for bold headlines and button labels. The brand's signature design moves include generous use of `{rounded.sm}` (8px) on buttons and cards, a consistent `{spacing.base}` (16px) grid, and a `{spacing.section}` (64px) rhythm that gives each product page room to breathe. The overall feeling is one of curated simplicity — nothing feels rushed or over-designed, and every color, corner, and spacing choice reinforces the idea of "better rugs, made with intention."

## Components

### Buttons
**`button-primary`** — The primary call-to-action, used for "Add to Cart", "Checkout", and key conversion points. Rendered in the deep navy (`#1f3041`) with white text and 8px rounded corners. On hover, shifts to `primary-active` (`#1e3042`). Disabled state uses `primary-disabled` (`#6a6c77`) with reduced opacity if needed. Text is set in P22UndergroundHeavy, uppercase, with 0.5px letter spacing for a deliberate, crafted feel.

**`button-secondary`** — An outlined variant for secondary actions like "View Details" or "Save for Later". Uses the same typography and sizing as primary but with a transparent background, navy text, and a 1px solid navy border. Hover state fills the background with a subtle tint of the primary color.

**`button-accent`** — A warm terracotta (`#b04e2d`) variant reserved for promotional CTAs, limited-time offers, or highlighting a special collection. Shares the same structural tokens as `button-primary` but swaps the background to the accent color.

**`button-tertiary-text`** — A text-only button for minimal interactions like "Cancel" or "Learn More". No background, no border, just the navy text in uppercase heavy weight. Hover adds a subtle underline or opacity shift.

### Cards
**`product-card`** — The core product display unit on collection pages and search results. Uses a warm off-white surface (`#e8e6db`) with 8px rounded corners. The product image sits at the top with matching rounded corners, followed by the rug name, size, and price in `body-sm`. A subtle shadow or border (`hairline`) separates the card from the canvas. On hover, the card may lift with a gentle box-shadow.

**`hero-banner`** — The full-width hero section on the homepage and landing pages. Background is the soft surface (`#ece8e0`), with the display headline in P22UndergroundHeavy at 48px. Padding is generous (`section` top/bottom, `base` sides) to allow the hero image to breathe. The hero may include a `button-primary` or `button-accent` CTA.

### Navigation
**`nav-bar`** — The top navigation bar, fixed at 72px height on desktop. Background is the canvas (`#fcfaf5`), with nav links in `nav-link` typography (P22UndergroundBook, 14px, 0.3px letter spacing). The logo sits on the left, links in the center, and utility icons (search, account, cart) on the right. On scroll, a subtle bottom border (`hairline`) appears.

**`link-nav`** — Standard navigation link styling. No background, no rounded corners, just the ink color and nav-link typography. Active state may use a bottom border or bolder weight.

### Forms
**`text-input`** — Standard text input for search, newsletter signup, and checkout forms. White background, 44px height, 8px rounded corners, and a 1px hairline border. On focus, the border transitions to the primary navy (`#1f3041`). Placeholder text uses `muted-soft` (`#c7cace`).

**`search-bar`** — A pill-shaped search input (`rounded.full`) used in the nav bar and mobile search. 48px height, white background, 1px hairline border, and body-md typography. The search icon is placed on the left, and a clear button appears on text entry.

### Badges
**`badge-new`** — A small terracotta badge (`#b04e2d`) used to flag new arrivals. 2px vertical padding, 8px horizontal, 4px rounded corners, and uppercase heavy typography at 11px.

**`badge-sale`** — An amber badge (`#994422`) for sale or markdown items. Same structural tokens as `badge-new` but with the amber background.

### Footer
**`footer`** — The site footer, a full-width block in the primary navy (`#1f3041`) with white text. Contains columns for customer service, about links, social icons, and a newsletter signup. Typography is `body-sm` for links and `caption` for headings. Padding is `xxl` (48px) top/bottom and `base` (16px) sides.

## Responsive Behavior

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile | < 744px | Single-column layout, hamburger nav, product cards stack vertically, hero text reduces to `display-md` (32px), footer collapses to stacked links |
| Tablet | 744–1128px | Two-column product grid, nav links remain visible but condensed, search bar collapses to icon-only, hero maintains two-column layout |
| Desktop | 1128–1440px | Full three-column product grid, expanded nav with all links, search bar visible, hero with side-by-side text and image |
| Wide | > 1440px | Max-width container (1440px) centered, product grid expands to four columns, hero uses larger imagery and wider text block |

### Touch Targets
- All buttons and interactive elements maintain a minimum 44px height for touch accessibility.
- Nav bar links have a minimum 48px tap target on mobile.
- Product card CTAs are at least 44px tall with 16px horizontal padding.
- Search bar is 48px tall for easy thumb access.
- Icon buttons (cart, account, search) are 44x44px minimum.

### Collapsing Strategy
- On mobile, the top nav collapses to a hamburger menu with a slide-out drawer.
- The product filter sidebar collapses to a bottom sheet or modal on mobile.
- The footer link columns stack vertically on mobile, with accordion-style expand/collapse for each section.
- The hero banner reduces from two-column to single-column, with the image stacking below the text.
- Product image galleries collapse from thumbnails to a single swipeable carousel.

## Known Gaps

- Hover states for secondary and tertiary buttons could not be reliably extracted — assumed to use a subtle background tint or opacity shift.
- Error styling for form inputs (border color, error message typography) was not observed on the live site.
- Dark mode or high-contrast theme tokens are not present in the extracted data.
- Sub-brand or collection-specific palettes (e.g., "Outdoor", "Vintage") may exist but were not captured.
- The exact font weights for P22UndergroundBook and P22UndergroundHeavy were inferred from naming conventions; actual `font-weight` values may vary.
- The `link-blue` (`#007aff`) was observed in the CSS but its exact usage context (inline links vs. legal links) is assumed.
- The `swiper-icons` font-family declaration suggests a third-party carousel library is in use, but its styling tokens are not included.
- The `SofiaProMedium` font-family was found in the CSS but appears to be a fallback or unused declaration; it is not included in the typography system.
