  Deep botanical green (#007b5f) anchors every interaction on thesill.com — add-to-cart buttons, sticky nav highlights, and loyalty badges all pulse with the same forest-floor hue, making the chrome feel like a living extension of the product photography. The page opens on a warm cream canvas (#fdf9f3) rather than clinical white, lending an earthy softness that keeps full-bleed plant imagery from feeling sterile. Display type is set in Domaine Display, a high-contrast modern serif whose thin hairlines and generous x-height evoke editorial botanicals more than garden-center signage; it pairs with Gill Sans for navigation and button labels, producing a serif/sans rhythm that separates content from commerce without friction. Card radii stay moderate (`{rounded.md}`) — friendly enough for a lifestyle brand, structured enough for a product grid that regularly holds 12+ SKUs. Near-black ink (#141414) sits atop the cream ground at a contrast ratio well above 7:1, and a second-tier dark (#2a2d2f) handles long-form care guides without the heaviness of pure black. The hairline system splits into two weights: #dedede for card borders and #e2e2e2 for dividers inside modals and drawers, giving layered surfaces subtle depth without extra shadow. A muted blue (#334fb4) appears sparingly — link underlines in care-tip articles and the occasional seasonal collection badge — providing a complementary cool note against the dominant green. Spacing follows a 4px grid with generous `{spacing.section}` gaps (64px) between homepage modules, letting each plant collection breathe as its own vignette. Product cards run full-bleed imagery with a `{spacing.sm}` gutter and overlay a translucent surface-soft (#f6f6f6) strip at the bottom for price and quick-add, ensuring imagery dominates the scroll.

## Components

### Buttons

**`button-primary`** — Full green (#007b5f) fill with white text, 8px radius, and 48px height. On hover, darkens to `primary-active` (#006650) with a subtle 120ms ease transition. Disabled state fades to a muted sage (#99cfc2) with reduced opacity. Used exclusively for add-to-cart, checkout progression, and subscription CTAs.

**`button-secondary`** — White fill with a 1px hairline border and dark ink text. On hover the border strengthens to ink-color and the background tints to surface-soft. Employed for "View all" links, filter toggles, and secondary actions alongside a primary CTA.

**`button-tertiary`** — Text-only with primary-green color and an underline. No background or border. Used for inline links within editorial content and "Learn more" affordances beneath product descriptions.

### Navigation

**`nav-bar`** — 64px-tall white bar with a subtle bottom hairline. Logo sits left; main links (Plants, Pots & Planters, Care, Gifts, Subscriptions) are centered in `nav-link` weight-500 Gill Sans. Cart icon and account avatar anchor right. On scroll past 80px, the bar gains a soft drop shadow and sticks to viewport top. Mobile collapses to a hamburger with a slide-in drawer from the left.

**`announcement-bar`** — 40px full-width strip above the nav in solid primary green with white centered caption text. Cycles through promotional messages (free shipping threshold, seasonal sales) with a crossfade every 5 seconds.

### Product Cards

**`product-card`** — 12px rounded container with a 4:5 aspect-ratio plant image filling the top. Below the image: plant name in `title-sm`, pot/size variant in `caption`, and price in `price` typography. Hover lifts the card 2px with a soft shadow and reveals a quick-add overlay at the image base. Badges (bestseller, new, easy-care) position absolute at the image's top-left corner with an 8px offset.

**`quick-add-overlay`** — Translucent white strip that slides up from the bottom of the product-card image on hover. Contains a single "Quick Add" button in `button-md` typography. On mobile, this overlay is replaced by a persistent "+" icon button in the card's bottom-right.

### Plant Care Chips

**`plant-care-chip`** — Pill-shaped filter tokens for light level (Low, Medium, Bright), pet-friendliness, and size. Cream background with a hairline border in resting state; active state fills with primary green and switches text to white. Used on collection pages and the plant quiz flow.

### Pot Selector

**`pot-selector`** — 36px circular swatches on the PDP showing available planter colors. Each swatch is filled with the pot's color and outlined with a 2px hairline border. Active selection switches the border to primary green. Swatches sit in a horizontal row with `spacing.sm` gaps.

### Subscription Card

**`subscription-card`** — Rounded card offering one-time vs. subscription purchase on the PDP. Unselected cards show a hairline border; the selected option gains a 2px primary-green border and a small green checkmark icon in the top-right corner. Interior shows frequency dropdown (Monthly, Bi-monthly) and savings percentage in green caption text.

### Hero Banner

**`hero-banner`** — Full-width section on the homepage with a large lifestyle photograph (plant in context) on one side and display-xl serif headline on the other. Minimum height of 520px. CTA button sits below the subtitle with `spacing.lg` top margin. On mobile the layout stacks image-above-text.

### Search Modal

**`search-modal`** — Centered overlay triggered by the nav search icon. 12px rounded white card with a prominent text input at top, recent searches below, and trending product thumbnails in a 2×2 grid. Background scrim at 45% opacity. Escape or clicking the scrim dismisses.

### Footer

**`footer`** — Dark (#121212) full-bleed section with four columns: Shop, Learn, Company, Support. Headings in `title-sm` white text, links in `body-sm` with muted opacity that brightens on hover. Bottom row contains social icons, copyright, and payment-method badges. Newsletter signup input with a green submit button sits in the rightmost column.

### Toast Notification

**`toast-notification`** — Dark rounded pill that slides up from the bottom-center after add-to-cart. Shows a checkmark icon, product name, and "View Cart" text link. Auto-dismisses after 4 seconds with a fade-out; can also be swiped away on mobile.

## Responsive Behavior

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile | < 744px | Single-column product grid (2-up). Nav collapses to hamburger + cart icon. Hero stacks vertically. Footer accordion for link columns. Announcement bar text truncates to one line. |
| Tablet | 744–1128px | Product grid shifts to 3-up. Nav shows top-level links but mega-menu panels require tap. Hero uses 50/50 split. Pot selector scrolls horizontally if > 6 options. |
| Desktop | 1128–1440px | Full 4-up product grid. Mega-menu dropdowns on hover. Hero at natural 520px height. Sticky nav with shadow on scroll. Footer renders all four columns inline. |
| Wide | > 1440px | Content max-width caps at 1440px and centers. Product grid can stretch to 5-up on collection pages. Hero image scales proportionally, text size remains fixed. Side padding increases to 64px. |

### Touch Targets
- All tappable elements maintain a minimum 44×44px hit area on mobile, even if the visual element is smaller (e.g., pot-selector swatches use invisible padding).
- Care-chip filters stack into a horizontally-scrollable row with 8px gaps and 16px side padding on small screens.
- Quick-add on mobile uses a 40px circular "+" button rather than the full-width hover overlay.

### Collapsing Strategy
- Navigation mega-menu becomes a full-screen slide-in drawer on mobile with accordion sub-sections.
- Footer columns collapse into expandable accordions, each closed by default.
- PDP secondary info (shipping, returns, care guide) collapses into accordion panels below the main content on all breakpoints below desktop.
- Homepage collection carousels switch from a static grid to a swipeable horizontal scroll with peek (next card partially visible).

## Known Gaps

- Exact font-weight values for Domaine Display could not be confirmed from extraction alone; 600/700 are inferred from visual hierarchy.
- Gill Sans may be served as a web-font variant (e.g., Gill Sans Nova) with different metrics; the fallback to Inter covers rendering consistency.
- Hover transition durations and easing curves (assumed 120–200ms ease) were not extractable from static analysis.
- The warm cream canvas (#fdf9f3) may be conditional — some interior pages could use pure white (#ffffff) as canvas; extraction only confirms homepage usage.
- Mega-menu panel structure, including column counts and featured-image placement, was not fully captured.
- Loyalty/rewards program badge colors and tier system were not visible in the extracted palette.
- The blue accent (#334fb4) usage context is limited — it may be reserved for specific seasonal or editorial contexts rather than a permanent system token.
