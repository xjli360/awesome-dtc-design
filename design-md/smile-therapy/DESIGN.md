name: Smile Therapy
description: Smile Therapy is a bright, optimistic oral-care brand that feels more like a self-care ritual than a clinical routine. The palette centers on a vibrant teal (#108474) that reads as fresh, clean, and approachable — it's the brand's primary voltage, used across CTAs, badges, and key accents. This is balanced by a warm gold (#ebbf20) and a brighter yellow (#ffd700) that add a sense of reward and positivity, often appearing on sale badges or promotional elements. The canvas is a soft off-white (#f9fafb), with cards and surfaces in pure white (#ffffff) and a very light teal-tinted surface (#edf5f5) that whispers the brand color without overwhelming. Text runs in a deep navy-ink (#3a3b53) for body copy, with a near-black (#141414) for high-impact headlines, and a slate gray (#545454) for muted labels and secondary information. Typography leans on Archivo for display and heading work — a geometric sans-serif with a confident, modern stance — while Inter handles body text with its excellent readability at small sizes. The system uses soft, friendly radii: buttons and inputs round at {rounded.sm} (8px), cards at {rounded.md} (12px), and pill-shaped elements like search bars and badges go full round at {rounded.full}. There is a deliberate absence of harsh corners, reinforcing the "therapy" promise of gentle, soothing interactions. The overall mood is clean, warm, and slightly playful — a brand that wants you to enjoy taking care of your teeth.

## Components

### Buttons
**`button-primary`** — The primary call-to-action across the site, rendered in the brand teal (#108474) with white text. Used for "Add to Cart", "Subscribe Now", and primary checkout flows. On hover, it deepens to `{colors.primary-active}` (#0d6b5e). The disabled state uses `{colors.primary-disabled}` (#a3d5cc) to signal non-interactivity while maintaining brand color presence. All primary buttons use `{rounded.sm}` (8px) for a soft but not pill-like feel.

**`button-secondary`** — An outlined variant with a white fill and teal border, used for secondary actions like "Learn More" or "View Details". The active state darkens the border to `{colors.primary-active}`. This button maintains the same height and padding as the primary to ensure consistent vertical rhythm in forms and action bars.

**`button-ghost`** — A text-only button with no background or border, used in navigation drawers, modals, or as tertiary actions. Hover adds a subtle background tint (not yet tokenized). The ghost button respects the same typography and padding as the primary for alignment.

**`button-pill`** — A fully rounded pill button used for filter tags, category toggles, and compact actions. Uses `{rounded.full}` and smaller padding for a tighter footprint. The outline variant (`button-pill-outline`) swaps fill for a 1.5px border, ideal for "selected" states in filter groups.

### Cards
**`product-card`** — The standard product display card, used on collection pages and search results. Features a white background, `{rounded.md}` (12px) corners, and `{spacing.base}` (16px) padding. The image area uses `{rounded.sm}` (8px) to create a subtle nested radius effect. On hover, a soft box-shadow elevates the card. The card contains the product image, title, price, star rating, and a quick-add button.

**`testimonial-card`** — Used for customer reviews and social proof sections. Slightly more generous padding (`{spacing.lg}`) and a white background with `{rounded.md}` corners. The star rating uses `{colors.star-rating}` (#ebbf20) for a warm, gold-star aesthetic.

### Navigation
**`nav-bar`** — A fixed or sticky top navigation bar at 72px height. The background is white, and links use `{typography.nav-link}` — uppercase Archivo at 14px with 0.5px letter-spacing for a clean, editorial feel. The active link is underlined with a 2px teal border. Inactive links render in `{colors.muted}` (#545454). The nav bar contains the logo, primary links, search icon, and cart icon.

**`nav-link-active`** — The active state for navigation links, distinguished by a teal underline and the brand teal color. This is used for the current page or section indicator.

### Forms
**`text-input`** — Standard text input used for email signups, search fields, and form entries. White background with a `{colors.hairline}` (#dedede) border and `{rounded.sm}` corners. On focus, the border thickens to 1.5px and switches to `{colors.primary}`. Error state uses a red border (#d32f2f) — this is a known gap as the exact error red wasn't extracted from the site.

**`select-input`** — Dropdown select fields styled consistently with text inputs, using the same height, padding, and border treatment. The dropdown arrow is a custom chevron (not yet tokenized).

**`quantity-selector`** — A compact input for adjusting product quantities, with a border and `{rounded.sm}` corners. Contains minus/plus buttons flanking a numeric display.

### Badges
**`badge-sale`** — A gold-background badge (#ebbf20) with dark text, used to flag discounted items. The uppercase Archivo typography at 11px keeps it compact and legible. Padding is minimal (2px 8px) with `{rounded.xs}` (4px) corners.

**`badge-new`** — A teal-background badge (#108474) with white text, used for new arrivals. Same typography and sizing as the sale badge, but with the brand primary color to signal freshness.

**`badge-best-seller`** — A blue-background badge (#536cae) with white text, used for top-selling products. This blue is a secondary accent that adds variety to the badge system without competing with the primary teal.

### Footer
**`footer`** — A dark footer section (`{colors.footer-bg}` #333333) with light text (`{colors.footer-text}` #eeeeee). Links render in a slightly lighter gray (#f6f6f6) for readability. The footer uses `{typography.body-sm}` for general text and `{typography.title-sm}` for column headings. Padding is generous at `{spacing.section}` (64px) top and bottom.

### Hero
**`hero-banner`** — The primary hero section on the homepage, using `{colors.surface-soft}` (#edf5f5) as a subtle teal-tinted background. The headline uses `{typography.display-lg}` (30px Archivo bold) in the dark ink color. The CTA button (`hero-cta`) is a larger version of the primary button with 14px 32px padding and 48px height for visual prominence.

### Accordion
**`accordion`** — Used for FAQ sections and product details. White background with a soft border (`{colors.hairline-soft}` #e2e2e2) and `{rounded.sm}` corners. Each accordion item has `{spacing.base}` padding. The expand/collapse icon is a plus/minus toggle (not yet tokenized).

## Responsive Behavior

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile | < 744px | Single-column layout; nav collapses to hamburger menu; product cards stack vertically; hero text reduces to `{typography.display-md}`; buttons become full-width; footer columns stack; search bar moves to a persistent bottom bar or hidden behind an icon |
| Tablet | 744–1128px | Two-column product grid; nav links remain visible but may truncate; hero maintains two-column layout with reduced image size; side-by-side form layouts become stacked; footer shows 2-3 columns |
| Desktop | 1128–1440px | Three-column product grid; full nav bar with all links; hero uses full two-column layout; forms are inline; footer shows full 4-column layout |
| Wide | > 1440px | Max-width container (1440px) with centered content; product grid expands to 4 columns; hero content is centered with generous whitespace; all elements maintain proportional scaling |

### Touch Targets
- All interactive elements (buttons, links, inputs) have a minimum height of 44px to meet WCAG touch target guidelines.
- Icon-only buttons (search, cart, hamburger) are at least 44x44px.
- Quantity selector buttons are at least 40x40px.
- Accordion headers are at least 44px tall for easy tapping.
- Product card "Add to Cart" buttons are at least 44px tall on mobile.

### Collapsing Strategy
- Primary navigation collapses to a hamburger menu below 744px.
- The search bar collapses to a magnifying glass icon on mobile, expanding to a full-width overlay on tap.
- The footer collapses from 4 columns to 2 columns on tablet, and to a single column on mobile.
- Product grids collapse from 4 columns (wide) to 3 (desktop) to 2 (tablet) to 1 (mobile).
- Hero sections collapse from side-by-side text/image to stacked vertical layout on mobile.
- Multi-column form layouts collapse to single-column on mobile.
- Category filter strips collapse to a horizontal scrollable row on mobile.

## Known Gaps

- Hover states for ghost buttons and text links were not reliably extracted — assume a subtle background tint or underline on hover.
- Error styling for form validation (red borders, error message typography) was inferred; exact error red (#d32f2f) is an assumption.
- Focus ring styles (outline, box-shadow) were not observed — implement a 2px teal outline for keyboard navigation.
- Dark mode is not supported; no dark palette tokens were found.
- Sub-brand or seasonal palette variations (e.g., holiday themes) are not documented.
- Animation and transition timing values (ease, duration) were not extracted — use 200ms ease-in-out as a default.
- Loading states (skeleton screens, spinners) were not observed — implement a teal spinner matching `{colors.primary}`.
- Dropdown menu styles (mega menu, sub-navigation) were not captured.
- Modal and overlay styles (background scrim, close button) were not extracted — use `{colors.scrim}` (#000000 at 50% opacity) as an assumption.
- Tooltip and popover styles are undocumented.
- The exact font weights for Archivo and Inter beyond what's listed (400, 500, 600, 700) are assumed based on common usage.
- The `textTransform: uppercase` on nav-link and badge is inferred from the brand's clean, editorial feel but was not explicitly extracted.
- The `boxShadow` values for card hover states are assumed (0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)) and may differ from the live site.
- The `border` property on button-secondary (2px solid) is an assumption based on common secondary button patterns.
- The `fontSize` for star-rating (16px) is an assumption; actual size may vary.
- The `height` values for buttons and inputs are based on common DTC patterns and may not match the live site exactly.
