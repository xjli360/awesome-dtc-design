description: A deep black canvas (#080808) that feels less like a website and more like a listening room with the lights dimmed — the brand's entire visual system is built around the premise that the music, not the interface, should be the only thing you see. The four extracted grays (ink #4b4b4b, body #888888, muted #696969) form a restrained ladder that never competes with album artwork; text sits in Georgia and Times New Roman at modest sizes, evoking the typographic authority of a high-end audio magazine rather than a digital storefront. Navigation is a thin, almost invisible strip — no hero carousel, no promotional banners, just a sparse header with the label's logo and a handful of links. Product cards use `{rounded.none}` corners and `{spacing.base}` padding, as if to say the music inside needs no decorative frame. The primary action — adding an album to the cart — appears as a small, unassuming button in `{colors.primary}` (#080808) with white text, a deliberate anti-pattern in an ecommerce world of bright CTAs. The site reads as a direct translation of the label's physical catalog: black-and-white, precise, and utterly confident that the product (direct-to-disc audiophile recordings mastered by Pauler Acoustics) will speak for itself.

## Components

### Buttons
**`button-primary`** — A small, unassuming black rectangle (`{rounded.none}`) with white uppercase text in Arial Narrow. The button is deliberately understated — 32px tall with 8px 16px padding — so it never competes with album artwork. On hover, the background shifts to `{colors.primary-active}` (#1a1a1a). The disabled state uses `{colors.primary-disabled}` (#4b4b4b) with no border change. **`button-secondary`** — An outlined variant with a white background, black text, and a 1px black border. Same dimensions and typography as primary, used for "View Details" or "Learn More" actions where the primary action would be too heavy. **`button-tertiary-text`** — A text-only link styled as a button, used for "Cancel" or "Back to Catalog" actions. No background, no border, just the `{typography.button-md}` uppercase Arial Narrow in `{colors.primary}`.

### Navigation
**`nav-bar`** — A thin, 48px white strip at the top of every page. Navigation links use `{typography.nav-link}` — 12px uppercase Arial Narrow with 1.5px letter spacing — giving the header the density of a print magazine's table of contents. The active link is distinguished only by color (`{colors.primary}` vs `{colors.ink}`). No dropdowns, no mega-menus, no search bar in the header — the navigation is intentionally sparse. **`breadcrumb`** — A secondary navigation element in `{typography.caption}` (12px Arial) with `{colors.muted}` text. The active breadcrumb uses `{colors.primary}`. Separators are simple forward slashes with no additional spacing.

### Product Cards
**`product-card`** — A zero-radius white card with no shadow, no border, and no padding on the image. The album cover fills the full width of the card, and the title (`{typography.title-sm}`, 16px Georgia in `{colors.primary}`) sits directly below with `{spacing.sm}` gap. Price appears in `{typography.body-sm}` (13px Georgia, `{colors.muted}`). **`product-card-badge`** — A small black rectangle (`{rounded.none}`) with white uppercase text in 10px Arial Narrow, used for "NEW" or "SACD" format indicators. The badge sits in the top-left corner of the card image, overlapping the artwork.

### Forms
**`text-input`** — A 36px tall white input with a 1px `{colors.hairline}` border and `{rounded.none}`. On focus, the border switches to `{colors.primary}` (#080808). Placeholder text uses `{colors.muted-soft}` (#999999). **`search-bar`** — Identical to `text-input` in dimensions and styling, but used exclusively for the search function. No icon inside the input — search is triggered by pressing Enter. **`quantity-selector`** — A 32px tall input with a 1px `{colors.hairline}` border, used on the cart page for adjusting item quantities. The input is flanked by minus/plus buttons that are simple text characters in `{colors.primary}`.

### Footer
**`footer`** — A full-width black (`{colors.primary}`) band at the bottom of every page. Text is white in `{typography.body-sm}` (13px Georgia). Links use `{typography.link}` (14px Georgia) and are also white. The footer is divided into columns for "Shop", "About", "Contact", and "Newsletter" — the newsletter signup is a simple email input with a "Subscribe" button in `{colors.on-primary}` text on `{colors.primary-active}` background. No social media icons, no payment method logos — just text links and the label's address.

### Cart
**`cart-item`** — A single row in the cart, with the album cover thumbnail, title, format (e.g., "SACD", "Vinyl"), price, quantity selector, and remove link. Each item is separated by a 1px `{colors.hairline-soft}` border. The remove link uses `{typography.link}` in `{colors.muted}` — no red "Remove" button, just an understated text link.

## Responsive Behavior

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile | < 744px | Single-column product grid (1 item per row). Navigation collapses to hamburger menu. Footer stacks vertically. Search bar moves to top of page. |
| Tablet | 744–1128px | Two-column product grid. Navigation remains horizontal but with reduced padding. Footer displays in two columns. |
| Desktop | 1128–1440px | Three-column product grid. Full navigation with all links visible. Footer in four columns. |
| Wide | > 1440px | Four-column product grid. Maximum content width of 1440px with centered layout. |

### Touch Targets
- All interactive elements (buttons, links, inputs) have a minimum height of 32px and minimum width of 44px for touch targets.
- Navigation links have 48px touch targets (full height of the nav bar).
- Quantity selector buttons (minus/plus) are 32px × 32px.
- Product card images are tappable and link to the product detail page.

### Collapsing Strategy
- On mobile (< 744px), the top navigation collapses into a hamburger menu. The menu overlay is full-screen with a white background and black text.
- The product grid collapses from 3–4 columns on desktop to 2 columns on tablet and 1 column on mobile.
- The footer collapses from 4 columns on desktop to 2 columns on tablet and 1 column on mobile.
- The search bar, which is hidden on desktop (accessible via a small icon), becomes a persistent full-width element on mobile.
- Breadcrumbs are hidden on mobile to save space; only the current page title is shown.

## Known Gaps

- Hover and focus states for most components could not be reliably extracted from the live site. The `button-primary-active` and `text-input-focus` tokens are best guesses based on common patterns.
- Error styling (form validation, empty cart, 404 page) is not present in the extracted data. The `error` color (#cc0000) is a standard web convention, not a brand-specific value.
- The brand's sub-palette for different product formats (SACD, Vinyl, CD, Digital Download) could not be determined. The `product-card-badge` component uses the primary black, but the site may use color-coded badges.
- Dark mode is not supported. The site uses a white canvas with black text exclusively.
- The extracted font list includes "Comic Sans MS" and "cursive" — these are almost certainly fallback declarations in the site's CSS stack, not intentional brand fonts. The primary serif stack (Georgia, Times New Roman) and sans-serif stack (Arial Narrow, Arial, Helvetica) are the brand's actual choices.
- The extracted hex colors (#080808, #4b4b4b, #888888, #696969) are all grays — no accent color was found. This is consistent with the brand's minimalist, monochrome aesthetic, but it means there is no secondary or tertiary color in the system. The `error` and `success` colors are standard web defaults, not brand-specific.
- The site's use of `{rounded.none}` for all components is intentional and consistent — no rounded corners were found anywhere in the extracted CSS.
- The `button-primary` height of 32px is unusually small for ecommerce; this was confirmed by the extracted CSS and is a deliberate design choice to keep the interface unobtrusive.
