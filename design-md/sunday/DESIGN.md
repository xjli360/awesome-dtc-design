  Deep chlorophyll-dark green (#001c0e) floods the header and hero panels of getsunday.com the way a healthy lawn overtakes bare soil — completely, without apology. Where most outdoor brands default to sunny yellows or sky blues, Sunday anchors its entire interface in this near-black green, letting it serve as both navigation chrome and emotional signal: this is a brand that lives in the biology of grass, not the lifestyle photography around it. Typography splits into two clear voices — Lora, a bracketed serif, handles display headlines with an editorial warmth that echoes seed-catalog typography, while Inter carries every UI label, body paragraph, and call-to-action with Swiss neutrality. The pairing reads as "science journal meets garden journal," which maps precisely to Sunday's positioning as a soil-test-driven, custom-nutrient-plan lawn service. Buttons wear the brand's dark green at full saturation with white text (`{colors.on-primary}`), rounded to `{rounded.sm}` — not pill-shaped, not sharp, just enough softness to feel approachable without drifting into playful. Product cards for nutrient pouches and pest-control bottles sit on a warm off-white canvas (`{colors.canvas}`) with generous `{spacing.lg}` gutters, and the overall density is deliberately low: Sunday sells a subscription that replaces dozens of hardware-store trips, so the page itself must feel unhurried. Accent greens (`{colors.accent-leaf}`) appear sparingly on badges, progress indicators, and plan-status chips, providing a lighter counterpoint to the dominant dark. Photography dominates above-fold real estate — overhead shots of lawns, close-ups of soil, macro grass blades — and the UI recedes behind generous whitespace and restrained type scale, trusting the imagery to carry desire while the system handles clarity.

## Components

### Buttons

**`button-primary`** — Full dark-green (#001c0e) background with white text set in Inter 600. The default height is 48px with 8px border radius, giving a grounded, confident feel without the playfulness of a pill shape. On hover, the background lightens slightly to `primary-active`; disabled state desaturates to a grey-green at reduced opacity. Used for all primary conversion actions: "Get My Plan," "Add to Cart," "Start Quiz."

**`button-secondary`** — White/canvas background with a 2px dark-green border and matching text color. Same dimensions as primary. Used alongside primary buttons for lower-priority actions like "Learn More" or "See Ingredients." On hover, the background shifts to `surface-soft` and the border darkens.

**`button-tertiary`** — Text-only with underline, no background or border. Compact padding, used inline within content blocks for navigational links that need more emphasis than a plain anchor but less weight than a bordered button.

### Navigation

**`nav-bar`** — Full-bleed dark green (#001c0e) bar at 72px height. Logo sits left in white; navigation links in Inter 500 at 15px appear center or right. The dark-on-dark treatment means the nav blends with hero sections that share the same background, creating a seamless top-of-page experience. On scroll, height compresses to 64px with a subtle shadow appearing beneath.

### Product Cards

**`product-card`** — White card with 12px radius, a barely-visible border in `hairline-soft`, and a whisper of box shadow. Product imagery fills a 1:1 square at the top with `rounded-sm` corners. Below the image: product name in `title-sm`, a one-line description in `body-sm` at `muted` color, and price in `title-md`. On hover, the card lifts 2px with an expanded shadow, signaling interactivity without animation excess.

### Hero Section

**`hero-section`** — Immersive dark-green background panel, typically full-viewport or near it (min 560px height). Large serif headlines in Lora 700 at 56px anchor the left or center, with a subheading in Inter at reduced opacity beneath. A primary CTA button sits below with generous top margin. Background photography (lawn aerial shots, soil close-ups) may underlay with a dark gradient overlay to maintain text legibility.

### Lawn Plan Card

**`lawn-plan-card`** — The signature conversion component. White card with a 2px accent-leaf green border that distinguishes it from standard product cards. Contains a personalized plan summary — lawn size, nutrient recommendations, shipment schedule. A small pill badge (`lawn-plan-badge`) in solid green marks the plan tier. Interior spacing is generous at 24px padding to let the data breathe.

### Soil Quiz / Onboarding Steps

**`soil-quiz-step`** — Centered card (max 600px) on the warm canvas background. Each quiz step contains a question in `display-sm` Lora, answer options as large tappable tiles (not radio buttons), and a progress bar at top. The progress bar uses `accent-leaf` for the filled portion against a light gray track, both pill-shaped at `rounded-full`.

### Subscription Toggle

**`subscription-toggle`** — Segmented control for one-time vs. subscription pricing. Inactive segments sit on `surface-soft`; the active segment snaps to `primary` with white text and full-pill radius. The component is 40px tall and compact enough to sit inline with pricing information on product pages.

### Testimonials

**`testimonial-card`** — White card with soft border, holding a quote in `body-md` italicized, a circular avatar at 48px, and attribution in `caption`. Cards arrange in a horizontal scroll on mobile or a 3-column grid on desktop.

### Footer

**`footer`** — Matches the nav's dark-green background, creating a visual bookend. Four columns of links in `body-sm` at 75% opacity, a newsletter signup input with `button-primary` inline submit, and legal/certification badges along the bottom row. Generous vertical padding (`section` spacing) keeps it from feeling cramped.

### Badges

**`badge-organic`** — Small uppercase label (Inter 700, 12px, 1px letter-spacing) on a soft green background with darker green text. Used on product cards and plan details to flag certifications, ingredient highlights, or seasonal availability.

## Responsive Behavior

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile | < 744px | Single-column layout. Hero headline drops to `display-md` (32px). Nav collapses to hamburger with slide-out drawer. Product cards stack vertically at full width. Soil quiz steps remain centered but gain more vertical padding. Footer columns stack to single column with accordion expand. |
| Tablet | 744–1128px | Two-column product grid. Hero headline at `display-lg` (44px). Nav links may partially show or remain in hamburger depending on count. Lawn plan card sits at ~80% width centered. Testimonials show 2-up. |
| Desktop | 1128–1440px | Three-column product grid. Full nav links visible. Hero section gains side-by-side text+image layout. Footer shows all four columns inline. Soil quiz remains max-width 600px centered. |
| Wide | > 1440px | Content max-width caps at 1440px and centers. Additional lateral whitespace on canvas background. Hero imagery may extend full-bleed while text content stays within max-width container. |

### Touch Targets

- All interactive elements maintain 44px minimum touch target on mobile, even if visually smaller
- Product card tap zones extend to full card area, not just the text or image
- Quiz answer tiles are at minimum 56px tall for comfortable thumb tapping
- Nav hamburger icon padded to 48×48px hit zone

### Collapsing Strategy

- Navigation links collapse into a hamburger menu below 744px, with a full-height slide-out panel on dark green background
- Product grids move from 3 → 2 → 1 columns as viewport narrows
- Hero layouts shift from side-by-side (text + image) to stacked (image above, text below) at tablet breakpoint
- Footer columns collapse into expandable accordions on mobile, with section headers as toggle triggers
- Subscription toggle maintains its pill shape but expands to full container width on mobile for easier tapping

## Known Gaps

- Only a single hex color (#001c0e) was extracted from the live site; the full palette (accent greens, canvas warmth, muted tones) is inferred from the dark-green primary and standard UI needs — these should be verified against the live rendering
- No additional brand colors (e.g., seasonal accent, error/warning states) could be confirmed from extraction
- Font weights and specific size scales for Inter and Lora are estimated from typical usage patterns — the site likely loads these via JS bundles that were not captured
- Icon system (line weight, size grid, custom vs. library) could not be determined
- Motion/animation tokens (easing curves, transition durations) are not documented
- Exact spacing values between components on the live site could not be measured from extraction alone
- Whether Lora is used purely for display or also for longer editorial content is uncertain
- Dark-mode or alternate theme existence could not be confirmed
