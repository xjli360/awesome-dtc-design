name: Super7
description: A sage-green (#aaccaa) backdrop sets Super7 apart from the typical black-and-neon action-figure store — this is a collector's destination that reads more like a gallery than a toy aisle. The brand's visual system runs on a restrained palette of near-whites (#f0f0f0, #dedede) and deep charcoals (#1a1a1a, #121212), with the sage acting as the single atmospheric note that signals "this is Super7." Product photography and large-format character art carry the energy; typography stays out of the way, with Inter at modest weights and sizes that let the figures command attention. The checkout and navigation feel intentionally quiet — a soft gray (#e1e3e4) for dividers and secondary surfaces, pill-shaped buttons (`{rounded.full}`) for add-to-cart actions, and a persistent top bar that keeps the brand mark and cart visible without competing with the product grid. The overall mood is that of a well-curated vinyl-toy shop: clean, slightly muted, with the color coming from the merchandise itself.

## Components

### Buttons
**`button-primary`** — The primary call-to-action, rendered as a pill-shaped button with a sage-green (`{colors.primary}`) background and dark text (`{colors.on-primary}`). On hover/active, it shifts to a deeper sage (`{colors.primary-active}`). The disabled state uses a lighter sage (`{colors.primary-disabled}`) with muted text. Used for "Add to Cart," "Checkout," and primary form submissions.

**`button-secondary`** — A white pill button with a thin hairline border (`{colors.hairline}`) and dark text. On active, the border becomes solid ink and the background shifts to `{colors.surface-soft}`. Used for "View Details," "Pre-Order," and secondary actions alongside the primary button.

**`button-ghost`** — A text-only pill button with no background or border. Used for "Cancel," "Back," and tertiary actions in modals or dropdowns. Hover state adds a subtle `{colors.surface-soft}` background.

### Navigation
**`nav-bar`** — A fixed top bar at 64px height with a white background and a single hairline bottom border. Contains the brand logo on the left, navigation links in the center, and cart/search icons on the right. The nav links use `{typography.nav-link}` at 14px with 500 weight.

**`nav-link-active`** — Active navigation link with a 2px solid underline in `{colors.ink}`. The text remains `{colors.ink}` for the active page.

**`nav-link-inactive`** — Inactive navigation link in `{colors.muted}`. On hover, the text shifts to `{colors.ink}`.

### Cards
**`product-card`** — A white card with subtle rounded corners (`{rounded.sm}`) and 16px padding. Contains a square product image with matching corner rounding, a title below in `{typography.title-sm}`, and a price in `{typography.body-md}`. Cards sit in a responsive grid with `{spacing.base}` gaps.

**`product-card-image`** — The product photo area, forced to a 1:1 aspect ratio with `{rounded.sm}`. Images are centered and cover the container.

### Badges
**`badge-sold-out`** — A small charcoal badge with white text, used to overlay sold-out items on product cards. Uses uppercase `{typography.badge}` at 11px.

**`badge-new`** — A small sage-green badge with dark text, used to highlight newly added items. Same typography as the sold-out badge but with brand color.

### Forms
**`text-input`** — A standard text input with a white background, 1px hairline border, and `{rounded.sm}` corners. On focus, the border switches to `{colors.ink}`. Used for search, email signup, and checkout forms.

**`search-bar`** — A pill-shaped search field with a soft gray background (`{colors.surface-soft}`) and muted placeholder text. On focus, the background becomes white and a solid ink border appears. Used in the mobile nav and header.

### Footer
**`footer`** — A dark charcoal (`{colors.accent-charcoal}`) footer with white text. Contains link columns, social icons, and legal text. Links use `{typography.link}` in white with hover underlines.

### Hero
**`hero-section`** — A full-width hero area with a soft gray background (`{colors.surface-soft}`) and generous padding. Contains a large headline in `{typography.display-xl}` and a supporting subtitle in `{typography.body-md}`. Used on category pages and promotional sections.

### Icons
**`icon-button`** — A circular icon button at 40x40px with no background. Used for social media icons, cart, and user account. Hover adds a `{colors.surface-soft}` background.

**`cart-badge`** — A small circular badge (20px minimum) with sage background, used to display cart item count. Positioned at the top-right of the cart icon.

## Responsive Behavior

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile | < 744px | Nav collapses to hamburger menu; product grid goes single-column; hero padding reduces to `{spacing.lg}`; search bar moves to a full-width expandable row |
| Tablet | 744–1128px | Nav links remain visible but condensed; product grid shows 2-3 columns; footer stacks into two rows |
| Desktop | 1128–1440px | Full nav with all links; product grid shows 4 columns; hero uses full `{spacing.section}` padding |
| Wide | > 1440px | Max-width container at 1440px; product grid can show 5 columns; hero content centers with larger type |

### Touch Targets
- All interactive elements (buttons, links, icons) have a minimum tap target of 44x44px
- Cart icon and search icon in the nav are wrapped in `{icon-button}` at 40px, with additional padding to meet the 44px target
- Product card links are the full card area, not just the title text
- Mobile nav hamburger menu button is 44x44px minimum

### Collapsing Strategy
- Navigation links collapse into a hamburger menu below 744px
- Product grid reduces from 4 columns to 2 columns on tablet, to 1 column on mobile
- Footer link columns collapse from 4 columns to 2 columns on tablet, to a single vertical stack on mobile
- Hero section reduces padding and stacks title/subtitle vertically on mobile
- Search bar becomes a full-width expandable field on mobile, triggered by a search icon tap

## Known Gaps

- The extracted color list is dominated by grays (#3a3a3a, #e1e3e4, #dedede, #f0f0f0, #1a1a1a, #121212) with one distinctive sage (#aaccaa). This sage is used as the primary brand color, but its exact usage (buttons, badges, accents) is inferred from common DTC patterns rather than extracted from the live site.
- Font weights for Inter are estimated based on common web usage (400 for body, 500-600 for headings, 600 for buttons). The live site may use different weight values.
- Hover and active states for buttons and links are based on standard interaction patterns, not extracted from the site's CSS.
- Error states, form validation styling, and disabled input styling are not available from the extraction.
- Dark mode support is unknown; the extracted palette suggests a light-only system.
- The `#aaccaa` hex may be a seasonal or promotional color rather than the permanent brand primary. If the site undergoes a redesign, this color may change.
- Sub-brand or collection-specific color palettes (e.g., for Godzilla, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, or other licensed lines) are not captured.
- The extracted font-family list only shows "Inter, sans-serif" — no fallback stack or variable font settings are available.
- Spacing values (padding, margins, gaps) are estimated from common e-commerce patterns and may differ from the actual site implementation.
- The product card aspect ratio (1:1) is assumed based on typical action-figure product photography; the actual site may use different ratios.
- The footer's dark background color (#1a1a1a) is inferred from the extracted charcoal hexes; the actual footer may use a different shade or include gradient overlays.
