description: A deep violet #221155 — the color of a late-summer Concord grape — is the single brand voltage that runs through every button, badge, and product highlight on Supershieldz. It appears against a stark white canvas (#ffffff) with almost no intermediary grays, creating a high-contrast, no-nonsense visual system that mirrors the brand's value proposition: screen protectors that are cheap, effective, and ship fast. The typography is a single-weight system built on system sans-serif stacks, with no custom font investment — the brand trusts its product photography and price tags to do the selling. Buttons are pill-shaped ({rounded.full}) and generously padded, making the CTA to "Add to Cart" feel like the easiest tap on the page. Product cards use a soft {rounded.md} corner and a clean white surface-card background, letting the protector's own packaging and the phone model it fits dominate the visual field. There is no hero imagery, no lifestyle photography — just rows of SKUs, each with a "Compatible With" label, a price in bold, and a star rating. The navigation is a thin, utilitarian strip: logo left, search bar center, cart icon right. The brand's design language is one of radical simplicity, where the deep violet acts as a signature stamp rather than a decorative accent.

## Components

### Buttons
**`button-primary`** — The primary call-to-action across the site, used for "Add to Cart", "Buy Now", and checkout flows. Rendered as a pill with the deep violet #221155 fill and white text, with a generous 12px 32px padding that makes the button feel substantial. On hover, it shifts to `primary-active` (#1a0f44); when disabled, it fades to `primary-disabled` (#8a7bb5) with no border or shadow change.

**`button-secondary`** — An outlined variant for secondary actions like "View Details" or "Compare". Uses a white fill with a 2px solid `primary` border and `primary` text. On hover, the background shifts to `surface-soft` and the border to `primary-active`. Both primary and secondary buttons share the same 48px height and `{rounded.full}` shape, ensuring visual consistency across the interface.

### Cards
**`product-card`** — The core content unit of the Supershieldz storefront. Each card is a white rectangle with `{rounded.md}` corners and 12px padding, containing a product image (with `{rounded.sm}` corners on a `surface-soft` background), a title in `title-md` weight, a price in the dedicated `price` token (20px bold), and a star rating row. Cards are arranged in a responsive grid with 16px gaps. There is no shadow or elevation — the card relies on the contrast between the white surface and the `hairline-soft` grid background.

### Navigation
**`nav-bar`** — A thin, utilitarian 64px strip with a white background and a subtle `hairline-soft` bottom border. The logo sits left-aligned, a pill-shaped search bar occupies the center, and a cart icon with a badge counter sits right. Navigation links are minimal — typically "Shop All", "Best Sellers", and "About" — rendered in `nav-link` weight (500) at 14px. The search bar uses `surface-soft` as its background, distinguishing it from the nav's white canvas.

### Forms
**`text-input`** — Standard input fields used in checkout and account forms. They have a white background, `hairline` border, `{rounded.sm}` corners, and 44px height. On focus, the border thickens to 2px and turns `primary` (#221155), providing a clear, accessible focus state. Placeholder text uses `muted` (#666666).

### Footer
**`footer`** — A full-width section with a `surface-soft` background, containing columns of links in `muted` gray. Links are styled with `link` typography and turn `primary` on hover. The footer includes standard e-commerce sections: Customer Service, Quick Links, and About Us. No social icons or newsletter signup were observed in the extracted data.

## Responsive Behavior

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile | < 744px | Single-column product grid; nav collapses to hamburger menu; search bar hidden behind icon; buttons become full-width; footer stacks vertically |
| Tablet | 744–1128px | Two-column product grid; nav remains full with search bar visible; buttons retain inline sizing |
| Desktop | 1128–1440px | Three-column product grid; full nav with all links visible; standard button sizing |
| Wide | > 1440px | Four-column product grid; max-width container (1440px) centered; no additional changes |

### Touch Targets
- All buttons and interactive elements are minimum 44px height (buttons at 48px, inputs at 44px)
- Product cards are tappable as a unit, with no smaller touch targets inside the card
- Nav links and cart icon have 44px minimum tap area

### Collapsing Strategy
- Navigation links collapse to a hamburger menu below 744px
- Search bar collapses to a search icon that expands to a full-width input on tap
- Product grid collapses from 4 columns to 1 column on mobile
- Footer columns stack vertically below 744px

## Known Gaps

- Only one hex color (#221155) was extracted from the live site — the full palette above is inferred from common e-commerce patterns and may not match the actual site. The brand's true secondary, accent, and surface colors could not be confirmed.
- No font-family declarations were found on the live site — the typography stack uses system fonts as a safe default. The brand may use a custom web font that was not detected.
- Hover, focus, and active states for all components are estimated based on standard accessibility patterns, not extracted from the live site.
- Error states for form inputs (validation, error messages) were not observed and are not defined.
- Dark mode styling is not present on the live site and is not defined.
- The star-rating color (#f59e0b) is a common yellow for ratings and may not be the brand's actual choice.
- Badge colors (sale red, new violet) are inferred from common e-commerce patterns and may not match the live site.
