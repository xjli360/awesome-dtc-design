name: Syncwire
description: A utilitarian, high-trust electronics accessories brand built on a near-monochrome palette anchored by #2c2d2e — a deep, almost-black charcoal that reads as industrial and serious — and lifted by a single, unapologetic accent: #ffaa47, a warm marigold that appears on sale badges, promotional banners, and the occasional CTA, injecting urgency without breaking the technical mood. The canvas is #f5f5f5, a cool off-white that avoids the sterile glare of pure white, while #dadce0 and #dedede form the hairline and surface-soft layers that organize dense product grids. Syncwire’s typography runs Poppins at 400–600 weight, a geometric sans-serif with open apertures that keep spec tables and bullet-point feature lists legible at small sizes. The brand’s signature design move is the product card: a white rectangle (`{rounded.sm}`) with a centered hero image, a thin #dadce0 border, and a two-line title in `{typography.title-md}` — no badges, no overlays, just the product, its name, and a price. The top nav is a full-bleed #2c2d2e strip with white Poppins nav links and a search icon, suggesting a warehouse-like catalog where findability matters more than editorial curation. Buttons are flat and rectangular (`{rounded.xs}`), filled with #5f85c1 — a muted slate-blue that serves as the primary CTA across add-to-cart and checkout flows, a color that feels more like a functional affordance than a brand statement. The footer collapses into a dense #1a1c1d column of legal links and payment icons, reinforcing the brand’s no-frills, infrastructure-first posture. Syncwire does not decorate; it organizes.

## Components

### Buttons
**`button-primary`** — The primary call-to-action across the site, used for "Add to Cart" and "Shop Now" actions. A flat, rectangular button in slate-blue `{colors.primary}` with white Poppins 500 text. On hover, it shifts to `{colors.primary-active}` (#0047ba), a deeper, more authoritative blue. The disabled state drops to `{colors.primary-disabled}` (#d3d3d3) with `{colors.muted}` text, signaling unavailability without ambiguity.

**`button-secondary`** — An outlined variant used for "View Details" and secondary product-page actions. White background, `{colors.primary}` text, and a 1px `{colors.primary}` border. Active state inverts to filled `{colors.primary}` with white text. Used where the primary button would overwhelm — in filter panels, review sections, and cart summaries.

**`button-accent-marigold`** — A high-visibility promotional button reserved for limited-time offers, clearance sales, and banner CTAs. Filled `{colors.accent-marigold}` (#ffaa47) with dark `{colors.ink}` text. This is the only warm color in the button system, creating a deliberate visual spike that draws the eye to deals.

**`button-accent-red`** — A compact, urgent button used for "Clearance" and "Last Chance" badges. Small format (`{typography.button-sm}`, 32px height) in `{colors.accent-red}` (#c62a32) with white text. Appears as a floating badge on product cards or as a standalone CTA in promotional strips.

### Cards
**`product-card`** — The core inventory unit of the Syncwire catalog. A white rectangle with `{rounded.sm}`, a 1px `{colors.hairline-soft}` border, and `{spacing.base}` padding. The product image sits at the top with `{rounded.xs}`, followed by the title in `{typography.title-md}` (16px Poppins 500, `{colors.ink}`), then the price in `{typography.price-sm}` (14px Poppins 500, `{colors.body}`). A `{colors.accent-marigold}` sale badge can overlay the image top-left when a discount is active. Out-of-stock items display a gray badge instead. Cards are arranged in a responsive grid — 2 columns on mobile, 3 on tablet, 4 on desktop — with `{spacing.base}` gaps.

**`review-card`** — A customer review block with the same white-background, thin-border treatment as the product card. Contains the reviewer's name (`{typography.title-sm}`), a date (`{typography.caption}`, `{colors.muted}`), a star rating rendered in `{colors.accent-marigold}` 16px stars, and the review body in `{typography.body-sm}`. No avatar or decorative elements — just structured data.

### Navigation
**`nav-bar`** — A full-width, 56px strip in `{colors.ink}` (#2c2d2e) with white nav links in Poppins 500. The brand logo sits left-aligned, search icon right-aligned, and category links (Cables, Chargers, Mounts, etc.) spread across the center. Active or hovered links shift to `{colors.accent-marigold}`. On mobile, the category links collapse into a hamburger menu; the search icon remains visible.

**`search-bar`** — A pill-shaped input (`{rounded.full}`) with a white background, `{colors.hairline}` border, and `{colors.body}` placeholder text. The search icon button sits inside the pill on the right, rendered in `{colors.muted}`. On focus, the border shifts to `{colors.primary}`. The bar expands to full width on mobile and sits within the nav-bar on desktop.

### Forms
**`text-input`** — A standard form input for checkout, account creation, and newsletter signup. White background, `{colors.hairline}` border, `{rounded.xs}`, 40px height. Focus state swaps the border to `{colors.primary}`. Error state (not extracted, see Known Gaps) would likely use `{colors.accent-red}`.

**`quantity-selector`** — A compact, three-part control for cart quantity adjustment. A decrement button, a numeric display, and an increment button, all within a single `{rounded.xs}` container with `{colors.hairline}` border. The buttons use `{colors.primary}` for their +/- symbols. The numeric display uses `{typography.body-md}`.

### Footer
**`footer`** — A dense, dark footer in `{colors.dark-bg}` (#1b1b1c) with `{colors.dark-muted}` (#aaaeb6) body text and white section headings (`{typography.title-sm}`). Links are `{typography.link}` in `{colors.dark-muted}`. The footer is organized into columns (About, Support, Legal, Social) on desktop, collapsing into a single stacked column on mobile. Payment icons (Shopify Pay, Klarna, Afterpay, etc.) sit at the bottom in a row, rendered in grayscale.

### Badges & Indicators
**`product-card-sale-badge`** — A small, uppercase badge (`{typography.badge}`, 10px Poppins 600) in `{colors.accent-marigold}` with `{colors.ink}` text. Used to flag discounted items. Positioned absolutely over the product card image top-left.

**`trust-badge`** — A subtle, low-contrast badge in `{colors.surface-soft}` (#ededed) with `{colors.muted}` text. Used for "Free Shipping", "1-Year Warranty", and "30-Day Returns" indicators on product detail pages and cart summaries.

## Responsive Behavior

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile | < 744px | Nav-bar collapses to hamburger menu; product grid goes to 2 columns; search bar becomes full-width below nav; footer stacks to single column; filter panel becomes a slide-out drawer. |
| Tablet | 744–1128px | Nav-bar shows all category links in condensed font; product grid at 3 columns; filter panel sits as a left sidebar on category pages; footer shows 2-column layout. |
| Desktop | 1128–1440px | Full nav-bar with expanded category links; product grid at 4 columns; filter panel as persistent left sidebar; footer at 4 columns; hero banner uses full-width layout. |
| Wide | > 1440px | Max-width container (1440px) centers content; product grid remains at 4 columns but with larger cards; hero banner uses constrained width with generous side margins. |

### Touch Targets
- All buttons and interactive elements are at least 40px tall (primary, secondary, text-input, quantity-selector).
- Nav-bar links have a minimum 44px tap area on mobile.
- Search icon button is 36px — slightly below the 40px recommendation but acceptable for an icon-only target.
- Product card tap target is the entire card surface, not just the title or button.

### Collapsing Strategy
- Nav-bar category links collapse into a hamburger drawer below 744px.
- Filter panel collapses into a slide-out drawer on mobile, triggered by a "Filters" button.
- Footer columns collapse from 4 to 2 to 1 as viewport shrinks.
- Product card grid reduces columns from 4 to 3 to 2.
- Hero banner reduces font size and padding on mobile, and may hide secondary text.

## Known Gaps

- **Hover states** for buttons, links, and cards were not reliably extracted from the live site CSS. The `primary-active` color (#0047ba) is inferred from the extracted palette but may not be the exact hover target.
- **Error and validation styling** for form inputs (red borders, error messages) was not observed. The `accent-red` (#c62a32) is a candidate but unconfirmed.
- **Focus ring styling** (outline, box-shadow) for keyboard navigation was not extracted. Likely uses `{colors.primary}` or `{colors.accent-marigold}` but unknown.
- **Dark mode** is not present on the live site. The `dark-*` colors in the palette are extracted from footer and nav elements, not from a system-level dark theme.
- **Sub-brand or variant palettes** (e.g., Syncwire Pro, Syncwire Home) were not detected. The palette above represents the main storefront only.
- **Typography scale** is inferred from Poppins usage patterns. Exact font sizes, weights, and line heights for `display-xl`, `display-md`, etc., are best-guess based on common e-commerce patterns and the extracted font-family. The live site may use different values.
- **Spacing system** is a standard 4px/8px scale. The `section` value (64px) is an estimate for consistent vertical rhythm.
- **Rounded corner values** are inferred from common patterns. The `rounded.xs` (4px) for buttons is a strong signal from the extracted CSS, but `rounded.sm` (8px) for cards and `rounded.full` for search bars are assumptions.
- **Checkout flow** uses Shopify's default checkout, which has its own design system (Shopify Pay buttons, Klarna/Afterpay widgets). These are not part of Syncwire's brand system and are noted as external dependencies.
- **Animation and transition timing** (hover fades, page transitions, loading states) were not extracted. Likely uses 150–300ms ease-in-out but unconfirmed.
- **Iconography style** (line weight, stroke width, color) was not extracted. The search icon is the only visible icon; its style is unknown.
