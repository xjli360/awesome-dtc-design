name: Tower 28
description: A clean, vegan, and cruelty-free beauty brand that feels like a breath of fresh air in the makeup aisle. Tower 28's visual identity is anchored on a warm, off-white canvas (`#fffaf7`) and a signature coral-orange (`#d74015`) that pulses through every primary CTA, badge, and accent — a color that reads as energetic but not aggressive, like a sunlit California poppy. The brand's palette is surprisingly complex for "clean beauty": deep berry tones (`#872626`, `#892628`) suggest lip and cheek stains, while a muted lavender (`#efe3f3`) and soft pink (`#f9e5fc`) whisper toward inclusivity and gentle femininity. Cool steel blues (`#676986`, `#9a9db1`) and a pale sky (`#bcdbff`) ground the system, preventing it from tipping into saccharine. Typography leans on Cooper Lt BT for display moments — a rounded, friendly serif that feels hand-drawn and approachable — paired with Scto Grotesk A Medium for body and buttons, giving the brand a crisp, editorial edge. Corners are softly rounded (`{rounded.sm}` for buttons, `{rounded.md}` for cards), and the overall spacing is generous (`{spacing.lg}` to `{spacing.xxl}`), letting each product breathe. The brand trusts its color stories and ingredient transparency over heavy ornamentation; there are no hard corners, no aggressive contrasts, just a warm, sun-washed minimalism that says "you can wear makeup and still be good to your skin."

## Components

### Buttons
**`button-primary`** — The brand's primary call-to-action, rendered in the signature coral-orange (`{colors.primary}`) with white text and a soft 8px radius (`{rounded.sm}`). On hover, it shifts to a brighter coral (`{colors.primary-active}`) for a subtle glow effect. The disabled state uses a muted off-white (`{colors.primary-disabled}`) with muted text, signaling unavailability without visual noise. Text is uppercase with generous letter-spacing, reinforcing the clean, editorial feel.

**`button-secondary`** — An outlined variant that inverts the primary: a white background with a 2px coral border and coral text. Active state swaps the border and text to the brighter coral (`{colors.primary-active}`). This button is used for secondary actions like "Add to Wishlist" or "Learn More" alongside primary CTAs.

**`button-tertiary-text`** — A text-only button with no background or border, using only the primary coral for text color. Ideal for inline actions like "View Details" or "Shop All" within cards or sections where a full button would feel heavy.

**`button-pill-primary`** — A fully pill-shaped variant (`{rounded.full}`) of the primary button, used for promotional badges, "Shop Now" calls in hero sections, or compact CTAs in navigation. The smaller text size (`{typography.button-sm}`) and tighter padding make it feel badge-like and friendly.

**`button-pill-outline`** — The outlined pill counterpart, with a transparent background and a 1px coral border. Used for "Subscribe" or "Get Notified" actions where a less assertive visual is desired.

### Cards
**`product-card`** — The standard product display card, with a white background, 12px rounded corners (`{rounded.md}`), and 16px padding. The card contains a product image with 8px rounded corners, a title in `{typography.title-sm}`, and a price in `{typography.body-md}`. Badges (new, sale, clean) are positioned at the top-left of the image area. On hover, the card may elevate with a subtle shadow.

**`hero-section`** — A full-width banner section with a soft gray background (`{colors.surface-soft}`) and large display typography. The hero CTA button sits prominently, using the primary coral with generous padding. This section is the brand's primary storytelling vehicle, often featuring lifestyle imagery and a single, clear value proposition.

### Navigation
**`nav-bar`** — A fixed or sticky top navigation bar, 72px tall, with a white background and uppercase nav links in `{typography.nav-link}`. The active link is underlined with a 2px coral border. On scroll, a subtle box shadow appears to separate the nav from the page content. The nav includes the brand logo, primary links, a search icon, and a cart icon.

**`nav-link-active`** — The active state for navigation links, distinguished by the brand's coral color and a bottom border. Inactive links use the dark ink color (`{colors.ink}`) with no underline.

### Forms
**`text-input`** — A standard text input field with a white background, 8px rounded corners, and a light gray border (`{colors.hairline}`). On focus, the border thickens to 2px and turns coral. Error states use a 2px berry border (`{colors.accent-berry}`). Padding is generous (12px vertical, 16px horizontal) for comfortable typing.

**`search-bar`** — A pill-shaped search input (`{rounded.full}`) with a white background and a light gray border. On focus, the border becomes 2px coral. Used in the navigation and on search result pages.

**`quantity-selector`** — A compact input for adjusting product quantities, with a white background, 8px rounded corners, and a light gray border. Used on product detail pages and in the cart.

### Badges
**`badge-new`** — A small, mint-green (`{colors.accent-mint}`) badge with dark text, indicating a new product launch. The 4px rounded corners and uppercase typography make it feel like a friendly sticker.

**`badge-sale`** — A berry-red (`{colors.accent-berry}`) badge with white text, used for sale or clearance items. The high contrast ensures it's immediately noticeable.

**`badge-clean`** — A sky-blue (`{colors.accent-sky}`) badge with dark text, signaling the brand's clean, vegan, and cruelty-free credentials. This badge is often used on product cards and detail pages to reinforce the brand's core values.

### Swatches
**`swatch-color`** — A 32px circular color swatch used for product shade selection. The selected state is indicated by a 2px coral outline with a 2px offset, ensuring the active shade is clearly visible even among similar colors.

### Accordion
**`accordion-header`** — A clickable header for collapsible sections (e.g., product details, ingredients, shipping info). Uses `{typography.title-sm}` with no background, and padding only on the top and bottom. The content area uses `{typography.body-sm}` with bottom padding for spacing.

## Responsive Behavior

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile | < 744px | Single-column layout; nav collapses to hamburger menu; product cards stack vertically; hero text reduces to `{typography.display-md}`; buttons become full-width; search bar moves to a dedicated overlay |
| Tablet | 744–1128px | Two-column grid for product cards; nav links remain visible but may be truncated; hero uses `{typography.display-lg}`; side-by-side layout for product details (image left, info right) |
| Desktop | 1128–1440px | Full three- or four-column grid for product cards; full nav bar with all links; hero uses `{typography.display-xl}`; maximum content width is 1128px, centered |
| Wide | > 1440px | Content remains centered at 1128px max-width; extra whitespace on sides; nav bar may include additional utility links; hero may feature full-bleed imagery |

### Touch Targets
- All interactive elements (buttons, links, inputs) have a minimum height of 44px and a minimum width of 44px to meet WCAG touch target guidelines.
- Navigation links have at least 48px of touch area, even if the text is smaller.
- Color swatches are 32px with additional padding to ensure a 44px touch target.
- Quantity selector buttons are 40px tall with generous clickable areas.

### Collapsing Strategy
- On mobile (< 744px), the top navigation collapses into a hamburger menu. The brand logo remains centered, and the cart icon is moved to the right of the hamburger.
- Product filters (e.g., by shade, category, price) collapse into a "Filter" button that opens a slide-out panel.
- The footer's multi-column link sections collapse into accordion-style lists to save vertical space.
- Hero sections may reduce image height and stack text above the CTA rather than overlaying it.
- Product detail pages collapse the image gallery into a single-column swipeable carousel, with thumbnails hidden.

## Known Gaps

- Hover and focus states for all components beyond primary/secondary buttons could not be reliably extracted (e.g., nav-link hover color, product-card hover shadow, text-input focus ring).
- Error and success states for forms (e.g., input validation messages, success banners) are not fully documented.
- Dark mode or high-contrast mode color overrides are not present in the extracted data.
- Sub-brand or seasonal palette variations (e.g., holiday collections, limited-edition drops) are not captured.
- The exact `box-shadow` values for card elevation, nav-bar sticky state, and modal overlays are inferred from common patterns but not extracted.
- Animation and transition timing (e.g., button hover duration, card hover lift) are not specified.
- The `font-weight` for Cooper Lt BT is assumed to be 400 (regular) as the extracted data does not include weight variations; the brand may use a single weight for display text.
- The `letter-spacing` and `textTransform` values for typography tokens are estimated based on common editorial beauty brand patterns and may differ from the live site's exact CSS.
- The `oke-widget-icons` font family is used for product review widgets (Okendo) and is not a core brand typeface; it is excluded from the typography system.
- The `inherit` and `serif` font-family declarations are generic fallbacks and are not used as primary tokens.
- The `!important` flag on `oke-widget-icons!important` is a specificity override and is not a design token.
