name: Unbottled
description: Unbottled is a French body-care brand that has built its entire visual identity around the conviction that solid, plastic-free products should feel like a small daily luxury, not a sacrifice. The palette is anchored by a warm, almost edible coral — `#f79b76` — that appears on primary buttons, badges, and accent elements, giving every interaction a soft, sunlit glow. This is balanced against a deep teal `#108474` used for secondary actions, selected-product highlights, and the brand's signature "solid" badge, creating a natural, botanical tension between earth and fruit. The canvas is a clean `#eeeeee` rather than pure white, lending the entire site a slightly warmer, more tactile feel than the typical stark e-commerce template. Typography relies on DM Sans for body text and DM Serif Display for headlines, a pairing that reads as both contemporary and artisanal — the serif brings a touch of editorial sophistication to product titles, while the sans keeps navigation and pricing clean. Accent yellows (`#fde16c`, `#fbcd0a`) and a muted lavender (`#a89cc8`) appear in limited, intentional doses — on sale badges, star ratings, and secondary informational tags — preventing the palette from feeling monochromatic. The brand's commitment to `{rounded.full}` pills for buttons and `{rounded.sm}` for cards creates a friendly, approachable interface where nothing feels sharp or industrial. This is a design system that trusts color over chrome, using generous `{spacing.xl}` and `{spacing.xxl}` gutters to let product photography and the warm coral-teal contrast breathe.

## Components

### Buttons
**`button-primary`** — The brand's primary call-to-action, rendered as a pill-shaped button in the signature coral `#f79b76`. On hover, it deepens to `#ff7743`; when disabled, it fades to a soft peach `#fdf2ee` with muted text. Used for "Add to Cart", "Subscribe", and primary checkout flows. The full rounded shape (`{rounded.full}`) and generous horizontal padding (`14px 28px`) make it feel tactile and inviting.

**`button-secondary`** — A teal `#108474` pill button used for secondary actions like "Learn More" or "Discover the Range". On hover, it subtly reduces opacity to 85% rather than changing color, maintaining the brand's clean teal identity. Shares the same dimensions and typography as the primary button for visual consistency.

**`button-outline`** — A transparent button with a `#dddddd` hairline border and dark ink text. On hover, the border thickens to `#333333` and the background fills with the soft surface tone `#f9fafb`. Used for "View Details" on product cards and secondary navigation paths where visual weight should be minimal.

### Cards
**`product-card`** — A white card with soft `{rounded.md}` corners and a subtle drop shadow (`0 1px 3px rgba(51,51,51,0.06)`). The product image sits flush to the top corners (`{rounded.md} {rounded.md} 0 0`), while text content below uses `{typography.body-sm}`. On hover, the shadow deepens to `0 4px 12px rgba(51,51,51,0.10)`, creating a gentle lift effect. Badges overlay the top-left of the image area.

**`product-card-badge`** — A small teal `#108474` pill badge with uppercase white text, positioned over product images to indicate "Solid" or "New" status. Sale variants use a bright yellow `#fbcd0a` background with dark ink text for urgency.

### Navigation
**`nav-bar`** — A 72px fixed-height bar on the `#eeeeee` canvas, separated from content by a soft `#e9e9e9` bottom border. Navigation links use uppercase `{typography.nav-link}` with 0.5px letter-spacing for a refined, editorial feel. On scroll, the bar transitions to a white background with a subtle shadow for visual separation.

**`search-bar`** — A pill-shaped search input with white background and `#dddddd` border. On focus, the border switches to the brand coral `#f79b76` and the placeholder text transitions from muted to ink. Designed for quick product lookup across the catalog.

### Forms
**`text-input`** — Standard form input with `{rounded.sm}` corners, white background, and a `#dddddd` border. On focus, the border doubles to 2px and adopts the primary coral. Error states use the active coral `#ff7743` for clear visual feedback. All inputs share a consistent 48px height for alignment.

**`quantity-selector`** — A compact horizontal control with `{rounded.sm}` corners on a soft `#f9fafb` background. The plus/minus buttons are transparent but maintain the same height, creating a clean, integrated look. Used on product detail pages for adjusting purchase amounts.

### Footer
**`footer-section`** — A dark `#333333` footer with white text, providing strong contrast to the warm canvas above. Links are rendered in `#888888` and shift to the brand coral on hover. Social media icons sit in soft circular buttons that fill with coral on interaction. The footer uses generous `{spacing.xxl}` padding to feel substantial without crowding.

## Responsive Behavior

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile | < 744px | Single-column product grid; nav collapses to hamburger; hero text scales to `{typography.display-md}`; buttons become full-width; footer stacks vertically |
| Tablet | 744–1128px | Two-column product grid; nav links remain visible but condensed; hero uses `{typography.display-xl}`; side-by-side footer columns |
| Desktop | 1128–1440px | Three-column product grid; full nav with all links; hero with large serif display; multi-column footer with social icons |
| Wide | > 1440px | Max-width container at 1440px; content centered; product grid can expand to four columns; hero uses larger imagery |

### Touch Targets
- All interactive elements (buttons, links, inputs) maintain a minimum 44px height for touch accessibility
- Icon buttons and social icons are exactly 40px, exceeding the 44px recommendation where visual density requires it
- Product card tap targets include the entire card surface, not just text links
- Quantity selector buttons are 40px tall with adequate spacing between plus/minus

### Collapsing Strategy
- Primary navigation collapses to a hamburger menu below 744px, with a slide-out drawer
- Product filters collapse into a modal overlay on mobile
- Multi-column footer collapses to a single stacked column below 744px
- Hero section reduces vertical padding from `{spacing.section}` to `{spacing.xxl}` on mobile
- Product image galleries switch from thumbnail strip to swipeable dots on mobile

## Known Gaps

- Hover states for secondary and outline buttons were inferred from common patterns; exact transition durations and easing curves were not extractable
- Error state styling for text inputs (iconography, helper text positioning) was not visible on the live site
- Dark mode palette is not defined; the brand currently operates in light mode only
- Sub-brand or seasonal palette variations (e.g., holiday collections) were not observed
- Loading states (skeleton screens, spinners) were not extractable from static analysis
- Focus ring styles (outline, offset, color) for keyboard navigation were not reliably captured
- Animation timing and easing curves for transitions (hover, focus, page load) are not specified
- Specific font weights for DM Sans and DM Serif Display beyond what appears in the typography section were not confirmed
- Star rating component sizing and spacing for mobile vs. desktop was not fully resolved
