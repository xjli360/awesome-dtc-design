description: A tabletop RPG brand that wears its gold #986c15 like a guild emblem — it appears on every primary CTA, product-badge border, and category header, anchoring a system that otherwise runs on cool grays (#747474, #3e3e3e, #aaaaaa) and a bone-white canvas (#f8f8f8). The extracted palette reveals a brand that uses color sparingly but with intention: a deep navy #003388 surfaces in footer links and secondary headers, a forest-green #65bc7b marks in-stock indicators, and a warning-red #d04544 flags sold-out or limited-run items. Type is where WizKids distinguishes itself — Captain Nelson, a serif inline printed face, appears on product titles and hero headers, while Klinic Slab Bold and Klinic Slab Book handle subheads and body copy, giving the site a letterpress-meets-gaming-guild feel. Open Sans and PT Sans serve as fallback workhorses for navigation and utility text. Product cards use soft {rounded.sm} corners and a light #ebeaea hairline, with hover states that shift the card background to #f9f9f9. The brand's signature move is the gold-accented badge — a {rounded.xs} pill in #986c15 with white text — that labels "New Release," "Pre-Order," and "Exclusive" across the catalog. Buttons follow a two-tier system: gold-filled for primary actions, gray-outlined (#747474) for secondary, both at 48px height with {rounded.sm} corners. The overall impression is a digital game shop that respects the tactility of physical miniatures and rulebooks — generous whitespace, restrained color, and typography that feels stamped rather than set.

## Components

### Buttons
**`button-primary`** — Gold-filled (#986c15) workhorse for all primary actions: "Add to Cart," "Pre-Order Now," "Subscribe." On hover, darkens to #7a5510. Disabled state uses a muted gold #d4b87a with reduced opacity. Text is white Open Sans 600 at 15px, with 8px rounded corners and 48px height for comfortable tap targets.

**`button-secondary`** — Outlined variant for secondary actions like "View Details" or "Compare." Uses a 1px #747474 border on white canvas, with text in the same muted gray. Active state shifts border and text to ink (#363839) with a #f6f6f6 background. Same 48px height and 8px radius as primary for visual consistency.

**`button-tertiary-text`** — Text-only link styled as a button, used for "Learn More" or "See All" in content sections. Gold #986c15 text with no background or border. Hover darkens to primary-active.

### Cards
**`product-card`** — The core catalog unit: a white card with a 1px #ebeaea border and 8px rounded corners. Contains a product image (full-width, no border-radius on top), a Klinic Slab Book title at 18px, a gold price in Open Sans 16px, and a stock indicator in green (#65bc7b) or red (#d04544). On hover, background shifts to #f6f6f6, border to #e0dede, and a subtle box-shadow appears. Badges (New, Pre-Order, Exclusive) overlay the top-left corner of the image area.

### Navigation
**`nav-bar`** — Fixed 72px white header with a 1px #ebeaea bottom border. Logo sits left (typically the WizKids wordmark or shield icon), with nav links in Open Sans 600 at 15px. Active page gets a 2px gold bottom border. Hover state tints links gold. Secondary nav items (Cart, Account, Search) sit right-aligned as icon buttons.

**`search-bar`** — Pill-shaped input with full border-radius, 44px height, and a 1px #e0dede border. On focus, border thickens to 2px gold. Placeholder text in #aaaaaa. Often paired with a search icon button.

### Forms
**`text-input`** — Standard form field for checkout, account creation, and filters. White background, 48px height, 8px radius, 1px #e0dede border. Focus state uses a 2px gold border. Error state switches to 2px #d04544. Padding is 12px vertical, 16px horizontal.

**`quantity-selector`** — Compact numeric input for cart line items. 40px height, 8px radius, 1px #e0dede border. Typically rendered as a row with minus/plus buttons flanking the number.

### Badges
**`badge`** — Small uppercase label in 11px Open Sans 700, 0.5px letter-spacing, with 4px rounded corners and 4px/10px padding. Three variants: gold (#986c15) for "New Release" and "Exclusive," green (#a0ce4e) for "In Stock" and "Sale," red (#e0284f) for "Limited" and "Clearance." Always white text.

### Footer
**`footer`** — Deep navy (#003388) full-width section with white text. Links render in #aaaaaa and lighten to white on hover. Typography is Open Sans 14px. Contains columns for Support, Community, Shop, and Legal. Social icons appear in a row at the bottom.

### Hero
**`hero-section`** — Full-width promotional area using Captain Nelson 48px for the headline and Klinic Slab Bold 36px for the subtitle. Background is white (#f8f8f8) with generous 64px vertical padding. Often features a large product image or lifestyle shot behind the text.

### Pagination
**`pagination`** — Numbered page controls at the bottom of catalog listings. Inactive numbers are gray (#747474) on white with 8px radius. Active page uses gold fill with white text. Previous/Next arrows use the same styling as inactive.

## Responsive Behavior

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile | < 744px | Single-column product grid; nav collapses to hamburger; hero font drops to 32px; search bar moves to sticky top; footer stacks vertically |
| Tablet | 744–1128px | Two-column product grid; nav shows top-level links only; hero at 40px; filter bar collapses to dropdown |
| Desktop | 1128–1440px | Three-column product grid; full nav visible; hero at 48px; persistent sidebar filters on category pages |
| Wide | > 1440px | Four-column product grid; max-width container at 1440px; hero scales to 56px |

### Touch Targets
- All buttons and interactive elements minimum 44px height (buttons at 48px, inputs at 48px, quantity selector at 40px)
- Nav links have 48px tap area even if text is smaller
- Product card tap target is the entire card surface
- Badges are minimum 24px height for touch

### Collapsing Strategy
- Top nav collapses to hamburger menu below 744px; secondary icons (cart, account, search) remain visible
- Product filters collapse to a single "Filter" button on mobile, opening a slide-out panel
- Footer columns stack vertically on mobile, with accordion-style expandable sections
- Hero image stacks below text on mobile (text first)
- Product grid collapses from 4 columns to 1 on mobile, 2 on tablet

## Known Gaps

- Hover and focus states for all components were inferred from common patterns; actual extracted hover colors were not available
- Error state styling for forms (red borders confirmed, but error message typography and iconography not extracted)
- Dark mode is not present on the live site; no dark palette tokens exist
- Sub-brand or franchise-specific palettes (Dungeons & Dragons, Magic: The Gathering, Pathfinder) may exist but were not extracted
- Animation and transition durations (hover fades, card lift, nav dropdown) not captured
- Loading states (skeleton screens, spinners) not observed
- Modal and overlay styling (cart drawer, quick-view, age-gate) not extracted
- The extracted font list includes "STIU Jason" and "awb-icons" which appear to be icon-font or system fonts; they are not used in the typography system
- Checkout flow (Shopify default) may override brand tokens for payment widgets (Afterpay, Klarna colors not included)
- Print stylesheet and accessibility focus outlines not verified
