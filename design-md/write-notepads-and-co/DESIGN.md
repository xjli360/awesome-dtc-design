  The ruled page is this brand's organizing metaphor: #ddfaf4, a barely-there
  mint that reads like fresh paper catching diffuse studio light, recurs as the
  primary hero surface, and the payoff arrives when #45bea6 — a seafoam teal
  with Caribbean warmth — appears as the single active voltage, carrying every
  cart button, hover ring, price highlight, and focused-input underline. Against
  it stands #1b175d, a near-indigo navy as dense as dried fountain pen ink,
  anchoring announcement bars, section headers, and editorial callouts; the
  brand owns two pigments that map almost literally onto the stationery ritual:
  blank page and mark made. The rest of the palette keeps its distance — a
  spine of near-blacks (#121212, #111827, #1f2937) handles body and navigation
  type; a warm-gray range (#555353, #606060, #6b7280) carries metadata and
  supporting copy without competing with product photography; hairlines and
  borders draw from a cooler family (#c7c7c7, #d1d1d1, #e5e7eb), keeping
  spiral-bound notebooks, brass-ferrule pencils, and matte-finish pen barrels
  clean and unframed. Typography could not be extracted from the live Shopify
  theme (see Known Gaps), but the "for Professionals & Creatives" brand
  positioning calls for a confident geometric or humanist sans-serif at medium
  weights — display sitting around 28–40px at 600–700, body at 16px/400 —
  authority earned through restraint rather than typographic muscle. Components
  follow a Shopify-standard grid inflected with light brand character: product
  cards wear {rounded.sm} corners and a 1px #d1d1d1 border; primary buttons
  fill the teal at {rounded.xs}; the mint surface (#ddfaf4) returns in a
  full-width newsletter band above the footer, echoing the blank-page energy of
  the hero, while the #121212 footer beneath it closes the page like a notebook
  cover laid flat. {rounded.full} appears only in the search icon affordance
  and circular icon buttons, never on primary CTAs.

## Components

### Buttons

**`button-primary`** — The principal CTA fills in the seafoam teal (#45bea6) with white type at `{typography.button-md}` weight, carrying 13px/24px padding to a 48px height and `{rounded.xs}` corners — minimal radius that reads as professional rather than playful. Hover nudges the fill to #3aaa94; active deepens to #349e8a; disabled washes out to #a8ddd5, the color of a pen running dry.

**`button-secondary`** — A white canvas outlined variant with a 1.5px #c7c7c7 border, matching height and type scale to `button-primary`. On hover the border lifts to teal and the background gains a #ddfaf4 tint, creating a clear two-level hierarchy without abrupt contrast shifts.

**`button-navy`** — Deep #1b175d fill used in announcement bars, sale callouts, and editorial sections where the teal would compete with product photography. Shares the same 48px height and `{typography.button-md}` type scale as the primary for visual alignment across contexts.

### Navigation

**`nav-bar`** — 64px tall, white canvas, anchored by a single 1px #d1d1d1 bottom border. Brand logo sits left; desktop links in `{typography.nav-link}` occupy the center; cart count, search, and account icons fill the right. On scroll the bar stays fixed with no opacity animation — the border alone signals elevation.

**`announcement-bar`** — 40px #1b175d navy band that spans the full viewport above the nav, reversed white type at 13px/500. Carries free-shipping thresholds and promotional codes. Functions visually as a notebook-cover band — the same deep ink blue that bookcovers and spines carry.

### Product Card

**`product-card`** — Rectangular card with 1px #d1d1d1 border and `{rounded.sm}` corners, housing a 4:5 portrait image that fills the upper portion. Below: title at `{typography.title-sm}`, price at `{typography.price-display}`, and optional badge positioned absolute at the top-left of the image. Hover lifts with a 4px 16px rgba shadow. No inline add-to-cart — the brand routes through the full PDP.

### Hero Banner

**`hero-banner`** — #ddfaf4 mint or white canvas background, `{typography.display-xl}` headline, `{typography.body-md}` supporting copy, and a single `button-primary` CTA. Minimum 540px tall on desktop with `{spacing.xxl}` vertical and `{spacing.section}` horizontal padding. The mint surface is the brand's most direct invocation of blank-page energy on the digital screen.

### Collection Card

**`collection-card`** — Full-bleed photography card with a `linear-gradient(to top, rgba(27,23,93,0.55) 0%, transparent 60%)` overlay — the navy from #1b175d used as the gradient anchor so the shadow reads on-brand rather than generic black. Collection name sits reversed in `{typography.title-md}` weight above the fade line.

### Badges

**`badge-new`** — Teal (#45bea6) pill at `{typography.label-caps}` (11px/600/uppercase/0.8px tracking), 3px × 8px padding, `{rounded.xs}` corners, positioned absolute top-left over product card images. **`badge-bestseller`** mirrors the shape in #1b175d navy. The two badge types never appear on the same card, keeping signal clean.

**`badge-sale`** — Red (#c0392b) fill, same label-caps type and rounded. Used exclusively in clearance and sale pricing contexts; the red is the only departure from the core teal/navy palette and signals urgency without decorative intent.

### Search

**`search-bar`** — Full-width overlay triggered from the nav search icon (a `{rounded.full}` circle button). 44px input height, `{colors.surface-neutral}` background, `{rounded.xs}` corners, 1px #d1d1d1 border that upgrades to 1.5px teal on focus. Muted magnifying-glass icon leads the field. Autocomplete results drop in a card panel with `{rounded.sm}` corners and a soft shadow.

### Newsletter Callout

**`newsletter-callout`** — Full-width #ddfaf4 stripe placed above the footer with no border-radius on the outer container — it bleeds edge to edge as a page-spanning band. `{typography.display-sm}` heading, `{typography.body-md}` subtext, inline email `text-input` paired with `button-primary`. The mint recurrence here bookends the page against the hero's opening surface.

### Footer

**`footer`** — Near-black (#121212) background that reads as a closed notebook cover. Four-column layout on desktop: brand statement or logo left, then Product, Company, and Support link columns. Links in #dedede, section headings in white `{typography.title-sm}`. Bottom strip carries copyright in `{colors.muted-soft}` at `{typography.caption}`. No top border — the background transition is separation enough.

### Mini Cart Drawer

**`mini-cart-drawer`** — 400px right-panel overlay with white background and 1px #d1d1d1 left border. Product rows carry 64px square thumbnails. Cart icon badge in `{colors.primary}` fill with `{colors.on-primary}` text. Checkout CTA at drawer base uses `button-primary` full width.

### Promo Section Card

**`promo-section-card`** — Mint (#ddfaf4) card used in editorial grid sections to spotlight featured products, gift guides, or maker stories. Deep navy #1b175d text at `{typography.display-sm}` heading weight creates the highest-contrast pairing in the palette. `{rounded.sm}` corners, no border, `{spacing.xxl}` internal padding.

## Responsive Behavior

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile | < 744px | Single-column product grid; nav collapses to hamburger + centered logo + cart icon; hero stacks headline above image; announcement-bar wraps to two lines; mini-cart drawer expands to full viewport width |
| Tablet | 744–1128px | Two-column product grid; nav shows logo + collapsed hamburger menu + cart/search icons; hero uses split layout at reduced padding; footer collapses to two columns |
| Desktop | 1128–1440px | Three- or four-column product grid; full horizontal nav with all category links visible; hero at full 540px height; footer four-column |
| Wide | > 1440px | Max-width container (~1440px) centered with generous side margins; grid and hero content constrain to container; no new layout shifts beyond white-space breathing room |

### Touch Targets

- Primary and secondary buttons maintain 48px minimum height at all breakpoints
- Cart, search, and account icons hit 44px × 44px minimum tap target on mobile
- Quantity selector increment and decrement buttons maintain 44px height with adequate horizontal tap zone
- Product option swatches are minimum 36px × 36px with 8px gap between adjacent options
- Announcement bar links carry 40px full-height tap target by default

### Collapsing Strategy

- Navigation: full horizontal links collapse to a full-height slide-in drawer at < 1024px; drawer overlays with white background and close button top-right; sub-navigation expands inline with accordion
- Footer: four columns → two columns at tablet → single stacked column at mobile; legal/copyright strip always renders below all content columns
- Hero banner: side-by-side split layout collapses to stacked image-above-text at < 744px; min-height reduces from 540px to auto
- Collection card grid: 4-up desktop → 2-up tablet → 2-up compact mobile with reduced card height
- Product card image aspect ratio (4:5) preserved at all breakpoints; card width follows the column grid

## Known Gaps

- No font-family stacks were extracted from the live Shopify theme; typography uses a Helvetica Neue / system-ui fallback and must be validated against the actual brand typeface before production use
- The site likely loads webfonts via Shopify CDN or a JS-injected stylesheet that was not captured in the extraction pass
- Meta theme-color was absent; no OS-level browser chrome accent color could be confirmed
- Exact button and card border-radius values are inferred from the brand's professional positioning — live component measurements were not captured
- Hover and active color variants for the primary teal (#45bea6) are derived by proportional darkening — no explicit hover hex was present in the extracted palette
- Sale badge red (#c0392b) follows e-commerce convention; no red was present in the extracted hex list and this value is not confirmed from the live site
- Animation timing, easing curves, and transition durations for hover states, drawer behavior, and cart interactions were not captured
- Exact header height and sticky-scroll behavior could not be confirmed from extraction alone
- Dark-mode or alternate color scheme support is unknown; the extracted palette shows no dark-surface tokens beyond the near-black ink colors
