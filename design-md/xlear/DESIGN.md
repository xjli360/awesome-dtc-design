name: Xlear
description: Xlear is a health-first oral care brand rooted in the science of xylitol, a natural sweetener that disrupts cavity-causing bacteria. The brand's visual identity reflects this clinical yet natural positioning — a clean white canvas (`#ffffff`) and soft gray surfaces (`#f9fafb`, `#f2f2f2`, `#efefef`) provide a sterile, trustworthy backdrop, while a vibrant green (`#3aaf4a`) and a deep teal (`#108474`) serve as the primary and secondary brand voltages. These greens appear on every primary CTA, badge, and accent, signaling freshness, health, and natural efficacy. A warm yellow (`#fbcd0a`) is used sparingly for highlights and promotional badges, adding a touch of approachability. Typography relies on the clean, geometric `Nunito Sans` for body and headings, with `Arial` and `Helvetica` as fallbacks, set at modest weights (400–700) to maintain readability and a clinical clarity. The brand avoids heavy typographic muscle, instead trusting generous whitespace and product photography to convey quality. Corners are softly rounded (`{rounded.sm}` for buttons, `{rounded.md}` for cards) to feel friendly and human, while the overall layout is structured and grid-based, reflecting a methodical, science-backed approach. The palette also includes a range of neutral grays (`#333333`, `#555555`, `#666666`, `#7b7b7b`, `#6c757d`, `#cccccc`, `#dddddd`, `#eeeeee`) for text, borders, and muted elements, ensuring a high-contrast, accessible reading experience. A subtle lavender (`#a89cc8`) and pale mint (`#c1e6e6`, `#e3f2e6`, `#edf5f5`) appear in supporting roles, likely for informational banners or category highlights, adding a gentle, calming dimension. The overall feel is that of a trusted health partner — clean, green, and evidence-based.

## Components

### Buttons
**`button-primary`** — The primary call-to-action, used for "Add to Cart", "Shop Now", and "Subscribe". It features a solid green (`{colors.primary}`) background with white text (`{colors.on-primary}`) and a soft 8px corner radius (`{rounded.sm}`). On hover, it transitions to a darker green (`{colors.primary-active}`). The disabled state uses a muted green (`{colors.primary-disabled}`) to indicate inactivity.

**`button-secondary`** — An outlined variant for secondary actions like "Learn More" or "View Details". It has a white background (`{colors.canvas}`) with a 2px green border (`{colors.primary}`) and green text. On hover, the background shifts to a soft gray (`{colors.surface-soft}`) and the border darkens (`{colors.primary-active}`).

**`button-tertiary-text`** — A text-only button for subtle actions like "Cancel" or "Clear". It has a transparent background and green text (`{colors.primary}`), relying on the `{typography.button-md}` weight for emphasis.

**`button-pill-primary`** — A fully rounded (`{rounded.full}`) pill-shaped button used for promotional banners or sticky CTAs. It uses the same green (`{colors.primary}`) and white scheme but with a smaller font (`{typography.button-sm}`) and tighter padding.

**`button-pill-secondary`** — A pill-shaped button using the teal secondary color (`{colors.secondary}`), ideal for differentiating a secondary promotional path or a "Bundle & Save" offer.

### Cards
**`product-card`** — The standard product listing card used on collection and search results pages. It has a white background (`{colors.surface-card}`), a subtle box shadow, and a 12px corner radius (`{rounded.md}`). The card image is clipped to the top corners. On hover, the shadow deepens to indicate interactivity. The title uses `{typography.title-sm}` in dark ink (`{colors.ink}`), while the price is set in `{typography.body-md}` with a bold green weight (`{colors.primary}`). A yellow badge (`{colors.accent-yellow}`) can overlay the image for "Sale" or "Best Seller" indicators.

### Navigation
**`nav-bar`** — The top-level site navigation, fixed at 72px height with a white background (`{colors.canvas}`). It contains the logo, product category links, a search icon, and a cart icon. Links use `{typography.nav-link}` and turn green (`{colors.primary}`) on hover and active states. When scrolled, a subtle box shadow is applied for depth.

### Forms
**`text-input`** — Standard text input for forms like "Email Address" or "Search". It has a white background, a 1px gray border (`{colors.hairline}`), and an 8px corner radius (`{rounded.sm}`). On focus, the border thickens to 2px and turns green (`{colors.primary}`). Error states use a red border (`{colors.error}`).

**`select-input`** — A dropdown selector, styled identically to `text-input` for consistency. Used for quantity selectors or filter dropdowns.

**`textarea`** — A multi-line text input, used in contact forms. Shares the same base styling as `text-input` but with a larger default height.

### Hero
**`hero-section`** — The primary hero banner on the homepage and key landing pages. It uses a soft gray background (`{colors.surface-soft}`) with a large headline (`{typography.display-xl}`) and a prominent green CTA button (`{hero-section-cta}`). The layout is centered with generous padding (`{spacing.section}` top and bottom).

### Search
**`search-bar`** — A fully rounded (`{rounded.full}`) search bar with a white background and a 1px gray border. It is used in the navigation and on search result pages. On focus, the border turns green and thickens to 2px.

### Footer
**`footer-section`** — The site footer, which uses a dark ink background (`{colors.ink}`) for high contrast. Text is white (`{colors.canvas}`), and links are a soft gray (`{colors.muted-soft}`) that turn green (`{colors.primary}`) on hover. The layout is divided into columns for navigation, support, and social links.

### Badges
**`badge-primary`** — A small, uppercase green badge (`{colors.primary}`) with white text, used for "NEW" or "Bestseller" labels. It has a 4px corner radius (`{rounded.xs}`) and tight padding.

**`badge-secondary`** — A teal badge (`{colors.secondary}`) for "Eco-Friendly" or "Natural" labels.

**`badge-yellow`** — A yellow badge (`{colors.accent-yellow}`) with dark text (`{colors.ink}`) for "Sale" or "Limited Time" promotions.

### Accordion
**`accordion-header`** — Used for FAQ sections or product descriptions. The header has a soft gray background (`{colors.surface-soft}`) and uses `{typography.title-sm}`. The content area below is white (`{colors.canvas}`) with body text.

### Divider
**`divider`** — A thin, 1px horizontal line using `{colors.hairline-soft}`. Used to separate sections or list items.

## Responsive Behavior

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile | < 744px | Single-column layout. Navigation collapses to a hamburger menu. Product cards stack vertically. Hero text reduces to `{typography.display-lg}`. Buttons become full-width. Footer columns stack. |
| Tablet | 744–1128px | Two-column grid for product listings. Navigation links remain visible but may be condensed. Hero uses a two-column layout with text and image side-by-side. |
| Desktop | 1128–1440px | Three or four-column grid for products. Full navigation with dropdowns. Standard hero layout. |
| Wide | > 1440px | Max-width container (1440px) centered on screen. Increased whitespace and padding. |

### Touch Targets
- All interactive elements (buttons, links, inputs) have a minimum touch target of 44x44px.
- Mobile navigation hamburger icon is 48x48px.
- Product card "Add to Cart" button is 48px tall.
- Search bar is 48px tall.

### Collapsing Strategy
- On mobile, the top navigation collapses into a hamburger menu. The menu slides in from the left or right.
- Product filters collapse into a "Filter" button that opens a modal or drawer.
- Multi-column footers collapse into a single column with accordion-style headers for each section.
- Hero sections may stack vertically instead of side-by-side.

## Known Gaps

- Hover and active states for all components are not fully extracted; only primary and secondary buttons have defined active states.
- Error styling for form inputs (e.g., error messages, iconography) is inferred but not confirmed from the live site.
- Dark mode is not supported and no tokens exist for it.
- Sub-brand or seasonal color palettes (e.g., for holidays or specific product lines) are not captured.
- The exact font weights and sizes for `Nunito Sans` are estimated based on common usage; the live site may use different values.
- The `JudgemeIcons` and `JudgemeStar` font families are used for review widgets but are not part of the core typography system.
- The `Baskerville` font family appears in the extracted hints but its usage is unclear; it may be used for a specific decorative element or legacy content.
- The `Almarai` font family is likely used for Arabic language support but is not part of the default system.

- The `inherit` font family declaration is a CSS default and not a design choice.
- The `sans-serif` fallback is standard and not a specific brand font.
- The `#151515` hex color is very close to `#1c1c1c` (ink) and may be a variant; it is not included as a separate token.
