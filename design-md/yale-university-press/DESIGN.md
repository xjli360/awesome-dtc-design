name: Yale University Press
description: A scholarly publisher whose visual system is built on the authority of a single deep blue — #3858e9 — that appears as the primary action color, the link color, and the accent that pulls the eye through dense informational pages. This blue, paired with a near-black ink (#1e1e1e) for body text and a muted #949494 for secondary metadata, creates a hierarchy that feels both academic and digitally crisp. The press uses a restrained palette: #e0e0e0 for hairline borders, #f0f0f0 for soft surfaces, and #ffffff for the canvas, with occasional accents of #cc1818 (a scholarly red for sale prices or alerts) and #4ab866 (for success states). The typography relies on system fonts — primarily -apple-system and Segoe UI — at modest sizes, with body text at 16px and headings that rarely exceed 28px, trusting the content's weight rather than typographic drama. Buttons use {rounded.sm} corners (8px), giving them a precise, unpretentious feel, while the search bar employs {rounded.full} pill shapes for a touch of approachability. The overall impression is that of a serious institution that has modernized without sacrificing gravitas — the blue is confident but not aggressive, the spacing generous but not wasteful, and the entire interface feels built for long reading sessions rather than quick transactions.

## Components

### Buttons
**`button-primary`** — The primary call-to-action, using the brand's deep blue (#3858e9) background with white text. On hover, it shifts to the darker active state (#183ad6). The disabled state uses a muted gray (#ababab) to indicate non-interactivity. All primary buttons use 8px rounded corners and 44px height for comfortable touch targets.

**`button-secondary`** — An outlined variant with a white background, blue text, and a 2px blue border. Used for secondary actions like "Learn More" or "View Details" alongside primary buttons. Maintains the same 44px height and 8px rounded corners for visual consistency.

**`button-tertiary-text`** — A text-only button with no background or border, using the primary blue for its text color. Used for less prominent actions like "Cancel" or "Skip" within forms or modals.

**`button-pill-search`** — A fully rounded pill-shaped button used for search submission or filter actions. Uses the primary blue background with white text, 40px height, and generous horizontal padding for a friendly, approachable feel.

### Navigation
**`nav-bar`** — The top navigation bar, 64px tall with a white background and a subtle bottom border (#e0e0e0). Navigation links use 15px font size with 0.2px letter spacing for a slightly refined, academic feel. Active links are underlined with a 2px blue border.

**`breadcrumb`** — Secondary navigation using 13px caption text in muted gray. The active breadcrumb item switches to the near-black ink color to indicate the current page.

### Cards
**`product-card`** — Book product cards with white backgrounds, 8px rounded corners, and 16px padding. On hover, a subtle box shadow lifts the card. Product images within cards use 4px rounded corners for a softer edge.

### Forms
**`text-input`** — Standard text input fields with white backgrounds, 8px rounded corners, and a 1px hairline border. On focus, the border thickens to 2px and switches to the primary blue for clear visual feedback.

**`search-bar`** — A pill-shaped search input with a soft gray background (#f0f0f0) and 48px height. On focus, a 2px blue border appears. Used primarily in the site header for book and author searches.

### Badges
**`badge-new`** — A small gold (#f0b849) badge with dark text, used to indicate new releases or recently added titles. Uses 4px rounded corners and uppercase 11px font.

**`badge-sale`** — A red (#cc1818) badge with white text, used to indicate discounted prices or special offers. Same sizing and styling as the new badge for visual consistency.

### Footer
**`footer`** — The site footer uses a dark near-black background (#1e1e1e) with white text. Links appear in a lighter muted gray (#cecece) for readability. The footer spans the full width with generous padding of 64px top/bottom and 32px sides.

## Responsive Behavior

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile | < 744px | Single-column layout, hamburger menu replaces top nav, product cards stack vertically, search bar collapses to icon-only, footer links stack |
| Tablet | 744–1128px | Two-column product grid, top nav shows limited links with "More" dropdown, search bar remains full but narrower |
| Desktop | 1128–1440px | Full top nav with all links, three-column product grid, search bar at full width, breadcrumbs visible |
| Wide | > 1440px | Max-width container (1440px) centered, additional whitespace on sides, product grid can expand to four columns |

### Touch Targets
- All interactive elements (buttons, links, inputs) maintain minimum 44px height
- Search bar and primary buttons use 48px height for comfortable tapping
- Icon buttons and badge elements use minimum 32px touch area
- Navigation links have 40px minimum touch height with adequate spacing

### Collapsing Strategy
- Top navigation collapses to hamburger menu below 744px
- Product grid reduces from 4 columns to 2 columns at tablet, then 1 column at mobile
- Search bar collapses to icon-only trigger on mobile, expanding to full-width overlay on tap
- Footer link columns stack vertically below 744px
- Breadcrumbs hide on mobile, replaced by "Back" button where needed
- Secondary navigation (category filters) collapses to dropdown select below 744px

## Known Gaps

- Extracted color list is heavily polluted with generic web framework colors (multiple blues, grays, and accent colors from WordPress/Shopify defaults). The true brand palette likely has fewer colors; the most distinctive primary appears to be #3858e9, but this should be verified against the actual brand style guide.
- No meta theme-color tag was found, so the browser chrome color is unknown.
- Font-family declarations were limited to system fonts; the brand may use a custom typeface (e.g., Yale's proprietary typeface) that wasn't detected in the extraction.
- Hover states for buttons and links are inferred from common patterns, not extracted from the live site.
- Error states for form inputs (validation colors, error messages) were not extracted.
- Dark mode styling is not present or not detected.
- Sub-brand or section-specific color variations (e.g., for different academic departments or series) are unknown.
- The exact spacing scale and component heights are estimated based on common patterns; actual values may differ.
- No extracted data for modal/dialog styling, tooltips, or notification banners.
- The accent color palette includes many colors that may be from third-party widgets (social icons, payment badges) rather than the brand's own design system.
